Based on the task description and the Critical Syntax Rules provided, here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed to ensure the correctness of finding the k-th element in a given array using 1-based indexing:

```dafny
// Dafny method without implementation
method KthElement(arr: array<int>, k: int) returns (result: int)
  requires (1 <= k) && (k <= arr.Length) // k is within the bounds of the array using 1-based indexing
  ensures (result == arr[k - 1]) // The result is equal to the k-th element of the array
{
  // Method implementation would go here
}
```
