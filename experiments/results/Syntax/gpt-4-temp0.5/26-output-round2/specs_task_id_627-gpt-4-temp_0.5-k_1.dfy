method SmallestMissingNumber(s: seq<int>) returns (v: int)
  requires forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |s| ==> s[i] < s[j] // s is sorted in strictly increasing order
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> s[i] >= 0 // all elements in s are natural numbers
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> s[i] < v // v is greater than all elements in s
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < v ==> i in s || v == i // v is the smallest missing number

  // Method implementation would go here
