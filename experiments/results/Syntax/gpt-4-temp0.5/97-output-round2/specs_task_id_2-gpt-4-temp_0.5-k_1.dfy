```dafny
method sharedElements (arr1: array<int>, arr2: array<int>) returns (res: seq<int>)
    requires arr1 != null && arr2 != null
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |res| ==> (res[i] in arr1[..]) && (res[i] in arr2[..])
    ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < arr1.Length && 0 <= j < arr2.Length && arr1[i] == arr2[j] ==> arr1[i] in res
```
This Dafny method has the following preconditions and postconditions:

- The precondition requires that both input arrays are not null.
- The first postcondition ensures that all elements in the result sequence are in both input arrays.
- The second postcondition ensures that if an element is in both input arrays, then it must be in the result sequence.
