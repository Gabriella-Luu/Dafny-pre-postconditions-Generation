```
Explanation:
- The precondition `requires n >= 1` ensures that the input is a positive integer.
- The first postcondition `ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |lucids| ==> lucids[i] >= 1 && lucids[i] <= n` ensures that all elements in the returned sequence are between 1 and n (inclusive).
- The second postcondition `ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |lucids| ==> lucids[i] < lucids[j]` ensures that the sequence is sorted in ascending order.
- The third postcondition `ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |lucids| - 1 ==> (lucids[i+1] - lucids[i]) % 2 != 0` ensures that the difference between any two consecutive numbers in the sequence is odd, which is a characteristic of lucid numbers.
- The fourth postcondition `ensures |lucids| > 0` ensures that the method returns at least one number, as the number 1 is a lucid number.
