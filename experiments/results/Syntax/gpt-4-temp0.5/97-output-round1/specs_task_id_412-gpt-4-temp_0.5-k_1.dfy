This method has the following preconditions and postconditions:
- Precondition: The input array must not be null.
- Postcondition 1: The size of the returned sequence must be less than or equal to the size of the input array.
- Postcondition 2: All elements in the returned sequence must be even.
- Postcondition 3: If an even number exists in the input array, it should exist in the returned sequence.
- Postcondition 4: Every element in the returned sequence must exist in the input array.
