// Dafny method without implementation
method SumOfFourthPowerOfOddNumbers(n: int) returns (sum: int)
  requires n >= 0 // n must be non-negative to have a meaningful sum of natural numbers
  ensures sum >= 0 // The sum of fourth powers of non-negative integers is non-negative
  ensures (forall k :: 0 <= k < n ==> sum >= k*k*k*k) // The sum must be at least as large as any single term in the sequence
  ensures (exists t :: t == sum) // There exists a value of sum that is the result of the computation

  // Method implementation would go here
