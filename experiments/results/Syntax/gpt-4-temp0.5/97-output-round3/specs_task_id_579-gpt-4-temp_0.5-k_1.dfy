```dafny
method DissimilarElements(a: array<int>, b: array<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
    requires a != null && b != null
    requires a.Length == b.Length
    ensures |result| <= a.Length
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < a.Length ==> ((a[i] in result) <==> !(a[i] in b[..]))
```
This is the dafny method with preconditions and postconditions. The preconditions ensure that both input arrays are not null and have the same length. The postconditions ensure that the resulting sequence is not longer than the input arrays and that each element in the resulting sequence is in array a but not in array b.
