```dafny
method toggleString(str: string) returns (res: string)
  ensures |res| == |str|
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |str| ==> (
    (str[i] in 'a'..'z' ==> res[i] == str[i] - 'a' + 'A') &&
    (str[i] in 'A'..'Z' ==> res[i] == str[i] - 'A' + 'a') &&
    (!(str[i] in 'a'..'z') && !(str[i] in 'A'..'Z') ==> res[i] == str[i])
  )
```
### Explanation:
- **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
  - The first postcondition ensures that the length of the resulting string `res` is the same as the input string `str`.
  - The second postcondition ensures that each character in `res` is the toggled case of the corresponding character in `str`. Specifically:
    - If the character in `str` is a lowercase letter (`'a'..'z'`), it is converted to uppercase in `res`.
    - If the character in `str` is an uppercase letter (`'A'..'Z'`), it is converted to lowercase in `res`.
    - If the character is not a letter (e.g., a digit or punctuation), it remains unchanged in `res`.

This ensures that the method correctly toggles the case of all characters in the input string while preserving non-letter characters.
