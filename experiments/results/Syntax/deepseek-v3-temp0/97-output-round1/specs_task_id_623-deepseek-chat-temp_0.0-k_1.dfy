```dafny
method nthNums(list: seq<int>, n: int) returns (res: seq<int>)
  requires n >= 0
  ensures |res| == |list|
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |list| ==> res[i] == Power(list[i], n)
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

This method signature includes the necessary preconditions and postconditions to ensure that the method correctly computes the n-th power of each element in the input sequence `list`. The precondition `requires n >= 0` ensures that the exponent is non-negative, which is necessary for the power operation to be well-defined. The postconditions ensure that the resulting sequence `res` has the same length as the input sequence `list` and that each element in `res` is the n-th power of the corresponding element in `list`. The `Power` function is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the Dafny program to compute the power of an integer.
