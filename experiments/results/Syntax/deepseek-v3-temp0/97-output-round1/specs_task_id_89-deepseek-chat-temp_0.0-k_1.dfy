```dafny
method closestNum(n: int) returns (res: int)
  requires n > 0
  ensures res < n
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < n ==> (i < n && i > res ==> i >= res)
```
### Explanation:
- **Precondition (`requires n > 0`)**: The method assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. This ensures that there is at least one number smaller than `n` to find.
  
- **Postcondition (`ensures res < n`)**: The result `res` must be strictly smaller than `n`.

- **Postcondition (`ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < n ==> (i < n && i > res ==> i >= res)`)**: This ensures that `res` is the closest number smaller than `n`. Specifically, for all integers `i` between `0` and `n`, if `i` is smaller than `n` and greater than `res`, then `i` must be greater than or equal to `res`. This guarantees that `res` is the largest number smaller than `n`.
