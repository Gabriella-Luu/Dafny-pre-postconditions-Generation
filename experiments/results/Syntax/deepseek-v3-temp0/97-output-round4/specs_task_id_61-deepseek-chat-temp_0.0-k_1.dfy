```dafny
method countSubstrings(str: string) returns (res: int)
  requires |str| >= 0
  ensures res >= 0
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i <= j < |str| ==> (
    (sumDigits(str[i..j]) == (j - i + 1)) <==> (exists k :: i <= k <= j && str[k] == '1')
  )
  ensures res == (|{ i, j | 0 <= i <= j < |str| && sumDigits(str[i..j]) == (j - i + 1) }|)
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Preconditions (`requires`)**:
  - `|str| >= 0`: Ensures the string length is non-negative, which is always true for valid strings in Dafny.

- **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
  - `res >= 0`: Ensures the result is non-negative, as the count of substrings cannot be negative.
  - The second `ensures` clause ensures that for any substring `str[i..j]`, the sum of its digits equals its length if and only if there exists at least one '1' in the substring.
  - The third `ensures` clause ensures that `res` is equal to the number of substrings where the sum of digits equals the length of the substring.

The method does not include the implementation, as per the task requirements.
