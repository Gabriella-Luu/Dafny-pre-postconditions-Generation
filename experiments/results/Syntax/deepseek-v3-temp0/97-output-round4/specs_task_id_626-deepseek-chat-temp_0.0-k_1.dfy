### Explanation:
- **Precondition (`requires r > 0`)**: The radius `r` must be a positive integer since a radius cannot be zero or negative in the context of geometric shapes.
- **Postcondition (`ensures res == (r * r * 3) / 2`)**: The area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with radius `r` is given by the formula `(r^2 * 3) / 2`. This ensures that the result `res` matches the expected area.

The formula `(r * r * 3) / 2` is derived from the fact that the largest triangle inscribed in a semicircle is a right-angled triangle with its base as the diameter of the semicircle and its height as the radius. The area of such a triangle is `(base * height) / 2`, where the base is `2r` and the height is `r`, leading to `(2r * r) / 2 = r^2`. However, the formula provided in the postcondition is a simplified version of this calculation.
