### Explanation:
- **Precondition (`requires n >= 1`)**: Ensures that the input `n` is a positive integer, as ludic numbers are defined for positive integers.
- **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
  - `|lucids| >= 1`: Ensures that the sequence `lucids` is not empty, as there is at least one ludic number (1) for any `n >= 1`.
  - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |lucids| ==> lucids[i] <= n`: Ensures that all elements in `lucids` are less than or equal to `n`.
  - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |lucids| ==> isLudic(lucids[i])`: Ensures that every element in `lucids` is a ludic number.
  - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |lucids| - 1 ==> lucids[i] < lucids[i + 1]`: Ensures that the sequence `lucids` is sorted in ascending order.
  - `forall x :: x in lucids ==> x <= n && isLudic(x)`: Ensures that every element in `lucids` is a ludic number and less than or equal to `n`.
  - `forall x :: x <= n && isLudic(x) ==> x in lucids`: Ensures that all ludic numbers less than or equal to `n` are included in `lucids`.

The function `isLudic` is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the program to check if a number is ludic.
