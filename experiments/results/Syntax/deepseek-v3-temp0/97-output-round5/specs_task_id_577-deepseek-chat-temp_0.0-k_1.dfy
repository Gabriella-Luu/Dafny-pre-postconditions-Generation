```dafny
method lastDigitFactorial(n: int) returns (res: int)
  requires n >= 0
  ensures res == (let lastDigit := n % 10 in 
                  if lastDigit == 0 then 1 else 
                  (1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 * 7 * 8 * 9 * 10)[0..lastDigit].Product())
```
### Explanation:
- **Precondition (`requires`):** The input `n` must be non-negative since factorial is defined for non-negative integers.
- **Postcondition (`ensures`):** The result `res` is the factorial of the last digit of `n`. The last digit is obtained using `n % 10`. The factorial is computed by taking the product of the sequence `[1, 2, 3, ..., 10]` up to the last digit. If the last digit is 0, the factorial is 1 by definition.

This ensures that the method correctly computes the factorial of the last digit of the input number.
