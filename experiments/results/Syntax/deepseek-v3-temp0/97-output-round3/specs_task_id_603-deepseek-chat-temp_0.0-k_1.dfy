// Dafny method without implementation
method getLudic(n: int) returns (lucids: seq<int>)
  requires n >= 1
  ensures |lucids| >= 0
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |lucids| ==> lucids[i] <= n
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |lucids| ==> isLudic(lucids[i])
  ensures forall x :: x <= n && isLudic(x) ==> x in lucids[..]

  // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Precondition (`requires n >= 1`)**: Ensures that the input `n` is a positive integer, as lucid numbers are defined for positive integers.
- **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
  1. `|lucids| >= 0`: Ensures that the sequence `lucids` is non-negative in length.
  2. `forall i :: 0 <= i < |lucids| ==> lucids[i] <= n`: Ensures that every element in `lucids` is less than or equal to `n`.
  3. `forall i :: 0 <= i < |lucids| ==> isLudic(lucids[i])`: Ensures that every element in `lucids` is a lucid number.
  4. `forall x :: x <= n && isLudic(x) ==> x in lucids[..]`: Ensures that all lucid numbers less than or equal to `n` are included in the sequence `lucids`.

Note: The function `isLudic` is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the program to check if a number is a lucid number.
