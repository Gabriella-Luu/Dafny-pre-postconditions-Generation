```dafny
method difference(n: int) returns (diff: int)
  requires n >= 0
  ensures diff == (sumOfCubes(n) - sumOfNumbers(n))
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i <= n ==> (i * i * i) - i >= 0 ==> diff >= 0
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Precondition (`requires n >= 0`)**: The method assumes that `n` is a non-negative integer since we are dealing with the first `n` natural numbers.
- **Postcondition (`ensures diff == (sumOfCubes(n) - sumOfNumbers(n))`)**: This ensures that the returned `diff` is the difference between the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
- **Postcondition (`ensures forall i :: 0 <= i <= n ==> (i * i * i) - i >= 0 ==> diff >= 0`)**: This ensures that if for every `i` in the range `0 <= i <= n`, the difference between the cube of `i` and `i` itself is non-negative, then the overall difference `diff` is also non-negative. This helps in verifying that the difference is always non-negative under certain conditions.

Note: The actual implementation of `sumOfCubes` and `sumOfNumbers` would need to be provided separately, but they are not included here as per the task's requirements.
