```dafny
method nthNums(list:seq<int>, n:int) returns (res: seq<int>)
  requires n >= 0
  requires n != 0 || (forall x :: x in list ==> x != 0)
  ensures |res| == |list|
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |res| ==> res[i] == (if n == 0 then 1 else list[i] * list[i] * (if n >= 2 then list[i] * (if n >= 3 then list[i] * (if n >= 4 then list[i] * (if n >= 5 then list[i] * (if n >= 6 then list[i] * (if n >= 7 then list[i] * (if n >= 8 then list[i] * (if n >= 9 then list[i] * (if n >= 10 then list[i] * list[i]^(n-10) else 1) else 1) else 1) else 1) else 1) else 1) else 1) else 1) else 1))
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
``` 

Wait, this is getting too complicated. But the problem says that the method signature is given, and the answer must only return the method with requires and ensures. Given the constraints, perhaps the correct answer is:

method nthNums(list:seq<int>, n:int) returns (res: seq<int>)
  requires n >= 0
  requires n != 0 || (forall x :: x in list ==> x != 0)
  ensures |res| == |list|
{
  // This ensures the length but not the values. But according to the rules, how to express the values?
}

But this is insufficient. Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer according to the given rules and the problem's requirements is:

```dafny
method nthNums(list:seq<int>, n:int) returns (res: seq<int>)
  requires n >= 0
  requires n != 0 || (forall x :: x in list ==> x != 0)
  ensures |res| == |list|
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |list| ==> res[i] == (if n == 0 then 1 else list[i] * (if n > 1 then list[i] * (if n > 2 then list[i] * (if n > 3 then list[i] * (if n > 4 then list[i] * (if n > 5 then list[i] * (if n > 6 then list[i] * (if n > 7 then list[i] * (if n > 8 then list[i] * (if n > 9 then list[i] * (if n > 10 then list[i] * (if n > 11 then list[i] * (if n > 12 then list[i] * ... else 1) else 1) else 1) else 1) else 1) else 1) else 1) else 1) else 1) else 1) else 1) else 1)
{
  // The ensures clause attempts to handle up to n=12, but this is not feasible for arbitrary n. However, the problem's rules prevent using functions, so this approach is invalid.
}
```

But this approach is not correct. Therefore, the only feasible answer under the given constraints is to include the preconditions and the length check in the postcondition, and leave the value check as best as possible, even if it's not fully correct. But that's not meeting the semantic requirements. 

After all this, I think the correct answer as per the rules and the problem's requirements is:

```dafny
method nthNums(list:seq<int>, n:int) returns (res: seq<int>)
  requires n >= 0
  requires n != 0 || (forall x :: x in list ==> x != 0)
  ensures |res| == |list|
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |res| ==> (n == 0 ==> res[i] == 1) && (n > 0 ==> res[i] == list[i] * res[i-1] / (if i > 0 then list[i-1]^(n-1) else 1))
{
  // This is incorrect and not feasible.
}
```

No, this is not correct. I think I have to admit that under the given constraints, the postcondition cannot be fully specified, but the best possible answer is to proceed with the preconditions and the length check. However, this is insufficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem's intended answer is:

```dafny
method nthNums(list:seq<int>, n:int) returns (res: seq<int>)
  requires n >= 0
  requires n != 0 || (forall x :: x in list ==> x != 0)
  ensures |res| == |list|
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |res| ==> res[i] == (if n == 0 then 1 else (list[i] * list[i] * (if n >= 2 then list[i] else 1) * (if n >= 3 then list[i] else 1) * ... ))
{
}
```

But again, this is not feasible for variable n. 

After struggling with this, I realize that the correct answer according to the problem's requirements and the given rules must include the preconditions and a postcondition that checks the length and the values for n=0. For n>0, it's impossible to check without a function or exponent operator. But the problem requires postconditions. Therefore, the answer must include:

```dafny
method nthNums(list:seq<int>, n:int) returns (res: seq<int>)
  requires n >= 0
  requires n != 0 || (forall x :: x in list ==> x != 0)
  ensures |res| == |list|
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |res| ==> (n == 0 ==> res[i] == 1)
{
}
```

But this leaves the postcondition incomplete. However, given the constraints, this is the best possible answer.
