```dafny
method closestNum(n: int) returns (res: int)
  requires n > 0
  ensures res < n
  ensures forall k :: 0 <= k < n ==> k <= res
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Precondition (`requires n > 0`)**: The method assumes that `n` is a positive integer. This is essential because the task is to find the closest smaller number than `n`, and if `n` is 0 or negative, the concept of "closest smaller number" might not be well-defined or meaningful.
  
- **Postconditions**:
  - `ensures res < n`: This ensures that the result `res` is indeed smaller than `n`.
  - `ensures forall k :: 0 <= k < n ==> k <= res`: This ensures that `res` is the largest possible number smaller than `n`. In other words, there is no number `k` between `0` and `n-1` that is larger than `res`. This guarantees that `res` is the closest smaller number to `n`.

These preconditions and postconditions are minimal yet sufficient to ensure the correctness of the method.
