```dafny
method findMin(list: seq<seq<int>>) returns (res: seq<int>)
  requires |list| > 0
  ensures |res| > 0
  ensures forall s :: s in list ==> |res| <= |s|
  ensures res in list
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Precondition (`requires |list| > 0`)**: Ensures that the input sequence `list` is not empty. This is necessary because finding the minimum length sublist in an empty list is undefined.
  
- **Postconditions**:
  - **`ensures |res| > 0`**: Ensures that the result `res` is a non-empty sequence. This is implied by the precondition that `list` is non-empty.
  - **`ensures forall s :: s in list ==> |res| <= |s|`**: Ensures that the length of `res` is less than or equal to the length of every sublist in `list`. This guarantees that `res` is indeed the sublist with the minimum length.
  - **`ensures res in list`**: Ensures that `res` is one of the sublists in the input sequence `list`. This ensures that the result is valid and comes from the input.

These conditions are minimal yet sufficient to verify the correctness of the method.
