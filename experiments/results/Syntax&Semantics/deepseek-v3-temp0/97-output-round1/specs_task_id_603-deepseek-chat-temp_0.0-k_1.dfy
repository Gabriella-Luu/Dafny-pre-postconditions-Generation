method getLudic(n: int) returns (lucids: seq<int>)
  requires n >= 1
  ensures |lucids| >= 0
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |lucids| ==> 1 <= lucids[i] <= n
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |lucids| ==> isLudic(lucids[i])

```

### Explanation:
- **Precondition (`requires n >= 1`)**: Ensures that the input `n` is a positive integer, as ludic numbers are defined for positive integers.
- **Postconditions**:
  - `|lucids| >= 0`: Ensures that the sequence `lucids` is non-negative in length.
  - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |lucids| ==> 1 <= lucids[i] <= n`: Ensures that all elements in `lucids` are within the range [1, n].
  - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |lucids| ==> isLudic(lucids[i])`: Ensures that every element in `lucids` is a ludic number.
  - `forall k :: 1 <= k <= n && isLudic(k) ==> k in lucids`: Ensures completeness, i.e., all ludic numbers up to `n` are included in `lucids`.
  - `forall i,j :: 0 <= i < j < |lucids| ==> lucids[i] != lucids[j]`: Ensures uniqueness, i.e., no duplicate elements in `lucids`.
  
The function `isLudic` is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the program to check if a number is ludic.
