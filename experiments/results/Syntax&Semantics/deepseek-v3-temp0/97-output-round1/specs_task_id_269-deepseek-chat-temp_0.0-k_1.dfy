```dafny
method asciiValue(ch: char) returns (res: int)
  ensures res == ch as int
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Preconditions**: None are needed because the method takes a `char` as input, and Dafny guarantees that `ch` is a valid character.
- **Postconditions**: The postcondition ensures that the result `res` is equal to the ASCII value of the character `ch`. This is achieved by casting `ch` to an `int`, which in Dafny gives the ASCII value of the character.
- **Logical Simplicity**: The postcondition is concise and directly relates the output to the input, ensuring correctness without unnecessary complexity.
