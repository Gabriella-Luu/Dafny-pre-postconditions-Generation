```dafny
method isProductEven(arr: array<int>) returns (res: bool)
  requires arr.Length > 0
  ensures res == (exists i :: 0 <= i < arr.Length && arr[i] % 2 == 0)
```
### Explanation:
- **Precondition (`requires`):** The array must have at least one element (`arr.Length > 0`). This is necessary because the product of an empty array is undefined.
  
- **Postcondition (`ensures`):** The result `res` is `true` if and only if there exists at least one element in the array that is even (`arr[i] % 2 == 0`). This ensures that the product of the array elements is even without actually computing the product.

This design adheres to the critical syntax rules and semantic requirements, ensuring logical simplicity and verification efficiency.
