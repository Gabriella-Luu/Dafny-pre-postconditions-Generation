```dafny
method countSubstrings(str: string) returns (res: int)
  requires |str| >= 0
  ensures res >= 0
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i <= j < |str| && (sumDigits(str[i..j+1]) == (j - i + 1)) ==> (exists k, l :: 0 <= k <= l < |str| && str[k..l+1] == str[i..j+1] && res > 0)
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i <= j < |str| && (sumDigits(str[i..j+1]) != (j - i + 1)) ==> (forall k, l :: 0 <= k <= l < |str| && str[k..l+1] == str[i..j+1] ==> res == old(res)))

}
```

### Explanation:
- **Preconditions**:
  - `requires |str| >= 0`: Ensures that the string length is non-negative, which is always true for valid strings in Dafny.

- **Postconditions**:
  - `ensures res >= 0`: Ensures that the result is non-negative, as the count of substrings cannot be negative.
  - The second `ensures` clause checks that for every substring `str[i..j+1]` where the sum of digits equals its length, there exists at least one such substring in the result.
  - The third `ensures` clause ensures that substrings that do not meet the condition do not affect the result.

The function `sumDigits` is assumed to be defined elsewhere and calculates the sum of digits in a given string. The postconditions ensure that the method correctly counts all substrings that meet the criteria and excludes those that do not.
