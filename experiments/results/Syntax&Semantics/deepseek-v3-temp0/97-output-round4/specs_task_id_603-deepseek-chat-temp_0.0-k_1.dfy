```dafny
method getLudic(n: int) returns (lucids: seq<int>)
  requires n >= 1
  ensures |lucids| >= 1
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |lucids| ==> 1 <= lucids[i] <= n
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |lucids| ==> isLudic(lucids[i])
  ensures forall k :: 1 <= k <= n && isLudic(k) ==> k in lucids
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |lucids| ==> lucids[i] != lucids[j]

  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Precondition (`requires n >= 1`)**: Ensures that the input `n` is a positive integer, as ludic numbers are defined for positive integers.
- **Postconditions**:
  - **`|lucids| >= 1`**: Ensures that the sequence `lucids` is not empty, as 1 is always a ludic number.
  - **`forall i :: 0 <= i < |lucids| ==> 1 <= lucids[i] <= n`**: Ensures that all elements in `lucids` are within the range [1, n].
  - **`forall i :: 0 <= i < |lucids| ==> isLudic(lucids[i])`**: Ensures that every element in `lucids` is a ludic number.
  - **`forall k :: 1 <= k <= n && isLudic(k) ==> k in lucids`**: Completeness check — ensures that all ludic numbers up to `n` are included in `lucids`.
  - **`forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |lucids| ==> lucids[i] != lucids[j]`**: Uniqueness check — ensures that there are no duplicate elements in `lucids`.

The function `isLudic` is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the program to check if a number is ludic.
