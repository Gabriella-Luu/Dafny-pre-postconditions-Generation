```dafny
method toggleString(str: string) returns (res: string)
  ensures |res| == |str|
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |str| ==> (
    (str[i] in 'a'..'z' ==> res[i] == str[i] - ('a' - 'A')) &&
    (str[i] in 'A'..'Z' ==> res[i] == str[i] + ('a' - 'A')) &&
    (!(str[i] in 'a'..'z') && !(str[i] in 'A'..'Z') ==> res[i] == str[i])
  )
```
### Explanation:
- **Preconditions**: None are needed because the method does not require any assumptions about the input string `str`.
- **Postconditions**:
  - The first `ensures` clause guarantees that the length of the result string `res` is the same as the input string `str`.
  - The second `ensures` clause ensures that each character in `res` is the toggled version of the corresponding character in `str`. Specifically:
    - If the character is a lowercase letter (`a`-`z`), it is converted to uppercase.
    - If the character is an uppercase letter (`A`-`Z`), it is converted to lowercase.
    - If the character is not a letter, it remains unchanged.
  - The postconditions are concise and cover all necessary logical checks without redundancy.
