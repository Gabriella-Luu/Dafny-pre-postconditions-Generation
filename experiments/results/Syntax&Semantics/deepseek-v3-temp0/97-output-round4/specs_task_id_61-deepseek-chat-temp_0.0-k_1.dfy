```dafny
method countSubstrings(str: string) returns (res: int)
  ensures res >= 0
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i <= j < |str| && (sumDigits(str[i..j+1]) == j - i + 1) ==> exists k, l :: 0 <= k <= l < |str| && str[k..l+1] == str[i..j+1] && res > 0
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i <= j < |str| && (sumDigits(str[i..j+1]) != j - i + 1) ==> !(exists k, l :: 0 <= k <= l < |str| && str[k..l+1] == str[i..j+1] && res > 0)

  // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Preconditions**: None are needed since the method does not require any specific assumptions about the input string `str`.
- **Postconditions**:
  - `res >= 0`: Ensures that the result is non-negative.
  - **Completeness Check**: Ensures that for every substring `str[i..j+1]` where the sum of digits equals its length, there exists a corresponding substring in the result.
  - **Exclusivity Check**: Ensures that no substring `str[i..j+1]` where the sum of digits does not equal its length is included in the result.
  - **Uniqueness Check**: Implicitly handled by the nature of counting substrings, as the method counts occurrences rather than listing them.

The postconditions ensure that the method correctly counts all substrings where the sum of digits equals their length, and no other substrings are included in the count.
