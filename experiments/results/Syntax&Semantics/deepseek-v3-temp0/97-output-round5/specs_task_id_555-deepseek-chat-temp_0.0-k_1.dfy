```dafny
method difference(n: int) returns (diff: int)
  requires n >= 0
  ensures diff == (sumOfCubes(n) - sumOfNumbers(n))
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i <= n ==> (i * i * i) - i >= 0 ==> diff >= 0
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Precondition (`requires n >= 0`)**: The method assumes that `n` is a non-negative integer, as the task involves summing the first `n` natural numbers and their cubes.
  
- **Postcondition (`ensures diff == (sumOfCubes(n) - sumOfNumbers(n))`)**: This ensures that the returned `diff` is the difference between the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

- **Postcondition (`ensures forall i :: 0 <= i <= n ==> (i * i * i) - i >= 0 ==> diff >= 0`)**: This ensures that if the difference between the cube of any natural number `i` (where `0 <= i <= n`) and `i` itself is non-negative, then the overall difference `diff` is also non-negative. This helps in verifying that the result is logically consistent with the properties of natural numbers.

The method is designed to be minimal yet sufficient, adhering to the critical syntax rules and semantic requirements.
