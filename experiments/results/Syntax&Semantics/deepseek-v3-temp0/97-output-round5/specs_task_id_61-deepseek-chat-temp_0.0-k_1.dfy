```dafny
method countSubstrings(str: string) returns (res: int)
  requires |str| >= 0
  ensures res == (|str| * (|str| + 1)) / 2 ==> (forall i, j :: 0 <= i <= j < |str| ==> (sumDigits(str[i..j+1]) == j - i + 1))
  ensures res >= 0
{
  // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Precondition (`requires`)**:
  - `|str| >= 0`: Ensures that the string length is non-negative, which is always true for valid strings in Dafny.

- **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
  - `res == (|str| * (|str| + 1)) / 2 ==> (forall i, j :: 0 <= i <= j < |str| ==> (sumDigits(str[i..j+1]) == j - i + 1))`: This ensures that if the result `res` equals the total number of possible substrings (which is `(|str| * (|str| + 1)) / 2`), then every substring must satisfy the condition that the sum of its digits equals its length. This is a completeness check.
  - `res >= 0`: Ensures that the result is non-negative, which is a basic sanity check.

The postconditions ensure that the method correctly counts all substrings where the sum of the digits equals the length of the substring, and no such substrings are missed or incorrectly counted.
