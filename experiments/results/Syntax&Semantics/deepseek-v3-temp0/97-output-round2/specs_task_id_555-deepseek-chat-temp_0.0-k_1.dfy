function sumOfCubes(n: int): int
  requires n >= 0
  ensures sumOfCubes(n) == (n * (n + 1) / 2) * (n * (n + 1) / 2)

function sumOfNumbers(n: int): int
  requires n >= 0
  ensures sumOfNumbers(n) == n * (n + 1) / 2
```

### Explanation:
- **Precondition (`requires n >= 0`)**: Ensures that `n` is a non-negative integer, as the sum of cubes and the sum of natural numbers are only defined for non-negative integers.
- **Postcondition (`ensures diff == (sumOfCubes(n) - sumOfNumbers(n))`)**: Ensures that the returned `diff` is the difference between the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
- **Postcondition (`ensures forall k :: 0 <= k <= n ==> sumOfCubes(k) >= sumOfNumbers(k)`)**: Ensures that for all `k` from 0 to `n`, the sum of cubes is always greater than or equal to the sum of numbers, which is a mathematical property of these sums.

The helper functions `sumOfCubes` and `sumOfNumbers` are used to compute the sum of cubes and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, respectively. These functions are defined with their own preconditions and postconditions to ensure correctness.
