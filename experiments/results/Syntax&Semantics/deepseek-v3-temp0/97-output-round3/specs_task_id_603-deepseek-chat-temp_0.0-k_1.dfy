  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |lucids| ==> isLudic(lucids[i])

### Explanation:
- **Precondition (`requires n >= 1`)**: Ensures that the input `n` is a positive integer, as ludic numbers are defined for positive integers.
- **Postconditions**:
  - `|lucids| >= 1 && lucids[0] == 1`: Ensures that the sequence `lucids` is non-empty and starts with 1, which is the first ludic number.
  - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |lucids| ==> lucids[i] <= n`: Ensures that all elements in `lucids` are less than or equal to `n`.
  - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |lucids| ==> isLudic(lucids[i])`: Ensures that every element in `lucids` is a ludic number.
  - `forall k :: 1 <= k <= n && isLudic(k) ==> k in lucids`: Ensures completeness, i.e., all ludic numbers up to `n` are included in `lucids`.
  - `forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |lucids| ==> lucids[i] != lucids[j]`: Ensures uniqueness, i.e., no duplicate elements in `lucids`.

The function `isLudic` is assumed to be defined elsewhere and checks if a number is ludic.
