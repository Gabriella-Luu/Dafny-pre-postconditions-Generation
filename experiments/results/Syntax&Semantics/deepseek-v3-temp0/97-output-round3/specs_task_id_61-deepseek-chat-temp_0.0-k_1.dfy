```dafny
method countSubstrings(str: string) returns (res: int)
  ensures res >= 0
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i <= j < |str| && (sumDigits(str[i..j+1]) == j - i + 1) ==> exists k, l :: 0 <= k <= l < |str| && str[k..l+1] == str[i..j+1] && res > 0
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i <= j < |str| && (sumDigits(str[i..j+1]) != j - i + 1) ==> !(exists k, l :: 0 <= k <= l < |str| && str[k..l+1] == str[i..j+1] && res > 0))

```

### Explanation:
- **Preconditions**: None are needed since the method does not require any specific assumptions about the input string `str`.
- **Postconditions**:
  - `res >= 0`: Ensures that the result is non-negative.
  - **Completeness Check**: The second `ensures` clause ensures that every substring whose sum of digits equals its length is counted in `res`.
  - **Exclusivity Check**: The third `ensures` clause ensures that no substring whose sum of digits does not equal its length is counted in `res`.
  - **Uniqueness Check**: Implicitly handled by the nature of counting substrings, as each valid substring is counted exactly once.

The function `sumDigits` is assumed to be defined elsewhere and calculates the sum of the digits in a given string.
