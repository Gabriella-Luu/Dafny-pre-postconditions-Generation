```dafny
method SmallestMissingNumber(s: seq<int>) returns (v: int)
    requires forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |s| ==> s[i] < s[j] // The sequence is sorted in ascending order
    requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> s[i] >= 0 // The sequence contains only natural numbers
    ensures (forall i :: 0 <= i < v ==> i in s) && !(v in s) // v is the smallest missing number
