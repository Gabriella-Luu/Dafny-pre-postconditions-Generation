    requires forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |s| ==> s[i] < s[j] // The sequence is strictly increasing
    requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> s[i] >= 0 // The sequence contains only natural numbers
    ensures 0 <= v // The smallest missing number is a natural number
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> s[i] != v // The smallest missing number is not in the sequence
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| && s[i] < v ==> exists j :: 0 <= j < |s| && s[j] == i // All natural numbers smaller than the smallest missing number are in the sequence
