```dafny
method findMin(list:seq<seq<int>>) returns (res: seq<int>)
    requires |list| > 0 // The list should not be empty
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |list| ==> |res| <= |list[i]| // The length of the returned sublist is less than or equal to the length of any other sublist
    ensures res in list // The returned sublist is a member of the original list
