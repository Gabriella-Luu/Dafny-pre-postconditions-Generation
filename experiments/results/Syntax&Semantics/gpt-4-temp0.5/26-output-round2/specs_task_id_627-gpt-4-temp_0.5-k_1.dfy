```dafny
method SmallestMissingNumber(s: seq<int>) returns (v: int)
  requires forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |s| ==> s[i] < s[j]  // The input sequence is sorted in ascending order.
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> s[i] >= 0  // The input sequence contains only natural numbers.
  ensures (v >= 0) && (v not in s) && (forall i :: 0 <= i < v ==> i in s)  // The returned value is a natural number not present in the input sequence and all natural numbers less than the returned value are present in the input sequence.

  // Implementation goes here
}
