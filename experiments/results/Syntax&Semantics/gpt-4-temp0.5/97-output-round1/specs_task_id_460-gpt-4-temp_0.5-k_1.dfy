    requires forall sublist :: sublist in list ==> |sublist| > 0  // Each sublist must have at least one element
    ensures |res| == |list|  // The result sequence has the same length as the input list
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |list| ==> list[i][0] == res[i]  // Each element in the result sequence is the first element of the corresponding sublist in the input list
