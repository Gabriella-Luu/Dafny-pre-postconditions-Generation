method divisionElements(test_tup1: seq<int>, test_tup2: seq<int>) returns (res: seq<int>)
    requires |test_tup1| == |test_tup2| // The two sequences must have the same length
    requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |test_tup2| ==> test_tup2[i] != 0 // No element in the second sequence can be zero to avoid division by zero
    ensures |res| == |test_tup1| // The result sequence should have the same length as the input sequences
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |res| ==> res[i] == test_tup1[i] / test_tup2[i] // Each element in the result sequence should be the division of the corresponding elements in the input sequences
