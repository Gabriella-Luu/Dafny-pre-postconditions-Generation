method indexMinimum(list: array<seq<int>>) returns (res:int)
  requires list != null && list.Length > 0; // the list is not null and has at least one sequence
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < list.Length ==> |list[i]| > 1; // each sequence in the list has at least two elements
  ensures 0 <= res < list.Length; // the result is a valid index in the list
  ensures forall j :: 0 <= j < list.Length ==> list[res][1] <= list[j][1]; // the second element of the sequence at the result index is the smallest among all second elements
  ensures exists k :: 0 <= k < list.Length && list[k][1] == list[res][1] && list[k][0] == list[res][0]; // the first element of the sequence at the result index is the first value of some sequence with the smallest second value
