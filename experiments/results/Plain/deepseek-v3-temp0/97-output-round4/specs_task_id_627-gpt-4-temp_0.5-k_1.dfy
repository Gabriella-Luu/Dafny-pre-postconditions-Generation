method SmallestMissingNumber(s: seq<int>) returns (v: int)
  requires forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |s| ==> s[i] <= s[j] // The sequence is sorted in non-decreasing order
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> s[i] >= 0 // The sequence contains only natural numbers
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < v ==> i in s // All numbers less than v are in the sequence
  ensures v >= 0 // The smallest missing number is a natural number
  ensures v not in s // v is not in the sequence
  ensures forall i :: i in s ==> i < v // All numbers in the sequence are less than v
