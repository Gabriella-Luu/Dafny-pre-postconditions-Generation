Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method Multiply(a: int, b: int) returns (result: int)
  // Preconditions: None, as integer multiplication in Dafny does not require specific constraints.
  // Postconditions: The result must be the product of a and b.
  ensures result == a * b
{
  // Implementation is omitted as per the request.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`)**: There are no specific preconditions needed for multiplying two integers in Dafny, as integer multiplication is well-defined for all integers.
2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**: The postcondition ensures that the `result` is equal to the product of `a` and `b`. This guarantees the correctness of the method.

This design ensures that the method behaves as expected and adheres to the task requirements.
