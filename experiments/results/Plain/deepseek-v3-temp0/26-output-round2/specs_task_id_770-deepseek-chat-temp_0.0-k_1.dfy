Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method SumOfFourthPowerOfOddNumbers(n: int) returns (sum: int)
  // Preconditions
  requires n >= 0 // n must be a non-negative integer
  // Postconditions
  ensures sum == sumFourthPowerOfOdds(n) // The sum equals the sum of the fourth power of the first n odd natural numbers
  ensures sum >= 0 // The sum is non-negative
{
  // Implementation is omitted
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`)**:
   - `n >= 0`: The input `n` must be a non-negative integer because we cannot have a negative number of terms in the sequence.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `sum == sumFourthPowerOfOdds(n)`: The result `sum` must equal the sum of the fourth power of the first `n` odd natural numbers. Here, `sumFourthPowerOfOdds(n)` is a hypothetical function that computes this sum (you would define this function separately in Dafny).
   - `sum >= 0`: The sum of fourth powers is always non-negative since any real number raised to an even power is non-negative.

This ensures the method is correct and adheres to the requirements. You would need to implement the logic to compute the sum of the fourth powers of the first `n` odd natural numbers.
