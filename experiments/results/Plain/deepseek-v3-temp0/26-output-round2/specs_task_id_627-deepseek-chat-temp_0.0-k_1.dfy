Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method SmallestMissingNumber(s: seq<int>) returns (v: int)
  // Preconditions
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> s[i] >= 0 // All elements are natural numbers
  requires forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |s| ==> s[i] <= s[j] // The sequence is sorted
  // Postconditions
  ensures v >= 0 // The result is a natural number
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> s[i] != v // The result is not in the sequence
  ensures forall k :: 0 <= k < v ==> exists i :: 0 <= i < |s| && s[i] == k // All numbers less than v are in the sequence
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> s[i] >= 0`: Ensures all elements in the sequence `s` are natural numbers (non-negative integers).
   - `forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |s| ==> s[i] <= s[j]`: Ensures the sequence `s` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - `v >= 0`: Ensures the result `v` is a natural number.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> s[i] != v`: Ensures the result `v` is not present in the sequence `s`.
   - `forall k :: 0 <= k < v ==> exists i :: 0 <= i < |s| && s[i] == k`: Ensures all natural numbers less than `v` are present in the sequence `s`. This guarantees that `v` is the smallest missing number.

This specification ensures the method correctly identifies the smallest missing natural number in a sorted sequence of natural numbers.
