Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method SumOfSquaresOfFirstNOddNumbers(n: int) returns (sum: int)
  // Precondition: n must be a non-negative integer
  requires n >= 0
  // Postcondition: sum is the sum of the squares of the first n odd natural numbers
  ensures sum == (n * (2 * n - 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 3
{
  // Implementation is omitted
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `n >= 0`: The input `n` must be a non-negative integer because the task involves calculating the sum of the first `n` odd natural numbers. Negative values for `n` are not meaningful in this context.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`)**:
   - `sum == (n * (2 * n - 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 3`: This formula represents the sum of the squares of the first `n` odd natural numbers. It is derived from the mathematical identity for the sum of squares of the first `n` odd numbers:
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{n} (2k - 1)^2 = \frac{n(2n - 1)(2n + 1)}{3}
     \]
   - This ensures that the returned `sum` is correct according to the task requirements.

The implementation is omitted as per the request, but the preconditions and postconditions are designed to verify the correctness of the method.
