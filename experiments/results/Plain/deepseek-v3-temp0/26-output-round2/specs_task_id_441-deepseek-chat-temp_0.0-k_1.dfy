Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method CubeSurfaceArea(size: int) returns (area: int)
  // Precondition: The size of the cube must be a non-negative integer.
  requires size >= 0
  // Postcondition: The surface area of the cube is correctly calculated as 6 * size^2.
  ensures area == 6 * size * size
{
  // Implementation is omitted as per the request.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`):**
   - The size of the cube must be a non-negative integer (`size >= 0`). This ensures that the input is valid, as a cube cannot have a negative size.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`):**
   - The surface area of the cube is correctly calculated as `6 * size * size`. This ensures that the method computes the surface area of a cube correctly, given the formula for the surface area of a cube is \(6 \times \text{size}^2\).
