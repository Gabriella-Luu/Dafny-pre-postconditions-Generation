Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions for the task of checking whether a given number is even:

```dafny
method IsEven(n: int) returns (result: bool)
  // Precondition: The input integer n must be a valid integer (no specific constraints needed for this task).
  requires n == n // This is a trivial precondition, as no specific constraints are needed.
  // Postcondition: The result is true if n is even, and false otherwise.
  ensures result == (n % 2 == 0)
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`):**
   - The precondition is trivial in this case because the method works for all integers. The condition `n == n` is always true and serves as a placeholder to indicate that no specific constraints are needed.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`):**
   - The postcondition ensures that the `result` is `true` if `n` is even (i.e., `n % 2 == 0`) and `false` otherwise. This directly captures the requirement of the task.
