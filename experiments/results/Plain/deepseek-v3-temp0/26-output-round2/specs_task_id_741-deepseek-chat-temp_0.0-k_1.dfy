Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed to verify whether all characters in a string are the same:

```dafny
method AllCharactersSame(s: string) returns (result: bool)
  // Precondition: The input string must not be null.
  requires s != null
  // Postcondition 1: If the string is empty or has only one character, the result is true.
  ensures s.Length == 0 || s.Length == 1 ==> result == true
  // Postcondition 2: If the string has more than one character, the result is true if and only if all characters are the same.
  ensures s.Length > 1 ==> (result == (forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < s.Length ==> s[i] == s[j]))
  // Postcondition 3: The result is always a boolean value.
  ensures result == true || result == false
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - The input string `s` must not be null. This ensures the method operates on a valid string.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - If the string is empty or has only one character, the result must be `true` because there are no differing characters.
   - If the string has more than one character, the result is `true` if and only if all characters in the string are the same. This is expressed using a universal quantifier (`forall`) to check that every pair of characters in the string is equal.
   - The result is always a boolean value (`true` or `false`), ensuring the method behaves as expected.

This design ensures the method is both correct and verifiable in Dafny.
