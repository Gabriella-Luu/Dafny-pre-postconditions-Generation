Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method countSubstrings(str: string) returns (res: int)
  // Preconditions
  requires str != null; // The input string must not be null
  // Postconditions
  ensures res >= 0; // The result is a non-negative integer
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i <= j < |str| && sumDigits(str[i..j+1]) == j - i + 1 ==> res > 0; // Ensures that for every valid substring where the sum of digits equals its length, the result is positive
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i <= j < |str| && sumDigits(str[i..j+1]) != j - i + 1 ==> res == 0; // Ensures that if no such substring exists, the result is zero
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`)**:
   - `str != null`: Ensures the input string is not null, as operating on a null string would lead to errors.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `res >= 0`: The result `res` must be a non-negative integer since it represents a count of substrings.
   - The second `ensures` ensures that for every valid substring `str[i..j+1]` where the sum of its digits equals its length, the result `res` is positive.
   - The third `ensures` ensures that if no such substring exists (i.e., no substring satisfies the condition), the result `res` is zero.

### Notes:
- The function `sumDigits` is assumed to compute the sum of the digits in a given substring. This function would need to be defined separately.
- The notation `str[i..j+1]` represents the substring from index `i` to `j` (inclusive).
- The postconditions are designed to capture the correctness of the method based on the problem requirements.
