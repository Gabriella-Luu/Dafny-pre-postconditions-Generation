Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed based on the task description:

```dafny
method diff(a: seq<int>, b: seq<int>) returns (diff: seq<int>)
  // Preconditions
  requires |a| > 0 && |b| > 0; // Both input lists must be non-empty
  // Postconditions
  ensures forall x :: x in diff ==> (x in a && x !in b); // Every element in diff is in a but not in b
  ensures forall x :: x in a && x !in b ==> x in diff; // Every element in a but not in b is in diff
  ensures |diff| <= |a|; // The size of diff is at most the size of a
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`)**:
   - `|a| > 0 && |b| > 0`: Ensures that both input lists `a` and `b` are non-empty. This is a reasonable assumption if the task expects meaningful differences between the lists.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `forall x :: x in diff ==> (x in a && x !in b)`: Ensures that every element in the resulting `diff` list is present in `a` but not in `b`.
   - `forall x :: x in a && x !in b ==> x in diff`: Ensures that every element in `a` that is not in `b` is included in `diff`. This guarantees completeness of the difference.
   - `|diff| <= |a|`: Ensures that the size of `diff` is at most the size of `a`, which is logically correct since `diff` cannot contain more elements than `a`.

This design ensures the correctness of the `diff` method by clearly specifying the expected behavior and constraints.
