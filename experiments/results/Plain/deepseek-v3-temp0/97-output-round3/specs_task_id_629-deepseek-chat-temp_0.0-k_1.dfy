Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method FindEvenNumbers(arr: array<int>) returns (evenList: seq<int>)
  requires arr != null // The input array must not be null
  ensures |evenList| <= arr.Length // The length of the evenList is at most the length of the input array
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |evenList| ==> evenList[i] % 2 == 0 // All elements in evenList are even
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < arr.Length && arr[i] % 2 == 0 ==> arr[i] in evenList // All even numbers in arr are included in evenList
{
  // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `arr != null`: Ensures the input array is not null to avoid null reference errors.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `|evenList| <= arr.Length`: The length of the resulting sequence `evenList` is at most the length of the input array, as it cannot contain more elements than the original array.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |evenList| ==> evenList[i] % 2 == 0`: Every element in `evenList` is even.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < arr.Length && arr[i] % 2 == 0 ==> arr[i] in evenList`: Every even number in the input array `arr` is included in `evenList`.

These conditions ensure the correctness of the method in finding even numbers from the array.
