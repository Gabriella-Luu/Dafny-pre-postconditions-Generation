Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed based on the task description:

```dafny
method DissimilarElements(a: array<int>, b: array<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
  requires a != null && b != null // Both input arrays must be non-null
  ensures |result| <= |a| + |b| // The result sequence length is at most the sum of the lengths of the input arrays
  ensures forall x :: x in result ==> (x in a[..] && x !in b[..]) || (x in b[..] && x !in a[..]) // Every element in the result is in one array but not the other
  ensures forall x :: (x in a[..] && x !in b[..]) || (x in b[..] && x !in a[..]) ==> x in result // Every element that is in one array but not the other is included in the result
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`)**:
   - `a != null && b != null`: Ensures that the input arrays `a` and `b` are not null, as working with null arrays would lead to runtime errors.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `|result| <= |a| + |b|`: The length of the result sequence is at most the sum of the lengths of the input arrays. This ensures the result is bounded by the input sizes.
   - `forall x :: x in result ==> (x in a[..] && x !in b[..]) || (x in b[..] && x !in a[..])`: Every element in the result sequence must be in one array but not the other. This ensures the result contains only dissimilar elements.
   - `forall x :: (x in a[..] && x !in b[..]) || (x in b[..] && x !in a[..]) ==> x in result`: Every element that is in one array but not the other must be included in the result. This ensures no dissimilar elements are missed.

These conditions ensure the method behaves as expected and verifies the correctness of the implementation.
