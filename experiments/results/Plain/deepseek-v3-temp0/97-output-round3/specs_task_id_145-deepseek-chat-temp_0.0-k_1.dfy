Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed for the task of finding the maximum absolute difference between any two elements in a given array:

```dafny
method maxAbsDiff(arr: array<int>) returns (res: int)
  requires arr.Length > 0 // Precondition: The array must not be empty
  ensures res >= 0 // Postcondition: The result is non-negative (absolute difference)
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < arr.Length && 0 <= j < arr.Length ==> res >= abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) // Postcondition: The result is at least as large as the absolute difference between any two elements
  ensures exists i, j :: 0 <= i < arr.Length && 0 <= j < arr.Length && res == abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) // Postcondition: The result is exactly the absolute difference between some pair of elements
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires arr.Length > 0`)**:
   - The array must not be empty because finding the maximum difference between elements in an empty array is undefined.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `res >= 0`: The result is non-negative since it represents an absolute difference.
   - `forall i, j :: 0 <= i < arr.Length && 0 <= j < arr.Length ==> res >= abs(arr[i] - arr[j])`: The result is at least as large as the absolute difference between any two elements in the array.
   - `exists i, j :: 0 <= i < arr.Length && 0 <= j < arr.Length && res == abs(arr[i] - arr[j])`: The result is exactly the absolute difference between some pair of elements in the array.

These conditions ensure the correctness of the method by specifying the expected behavior and constraints.
