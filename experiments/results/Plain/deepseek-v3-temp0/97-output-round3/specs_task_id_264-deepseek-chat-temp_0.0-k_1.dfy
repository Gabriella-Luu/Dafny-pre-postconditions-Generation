Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
// Dafny method without implementation
method dogAge(hAge: int) returns (res: int)
  // Precondition: The human age (hAge) must be a non-negative integer.
  requires hAge >= 0
  // Postcondition: The result (res) is the dog's age in dog years, calculated as 7 times the human age.
  ensures res == 7 * hAge
{
  // Implementation is omitted for now.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`):**
   - The human age (`hAge`) must be a non-negative integer (`hAge >= 0`). This ensures that the input is valid, as negative ages are not meaningful in this context.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`):**
   - The result (`res`) is the dog's age in dog years, calculated as 7 times the human age (`res == 7 * hAge`). This ensures the correctness of the calculation based on the common assumption that 1 human year equals 7 dog years.

This design ensures that the method is both safe (valid input) and correct (valid output).
