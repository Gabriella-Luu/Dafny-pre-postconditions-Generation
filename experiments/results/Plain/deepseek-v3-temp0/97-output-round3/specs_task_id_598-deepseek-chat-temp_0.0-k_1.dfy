Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions for checking whether a given number is an Armstrong number:

```dafny
method armstrongNumber(number: int) returns (res: bool)
  requires number >= 0 // Precondition: The input number must be non-negative
  ensures res == (number == SumOfDigitsRaisedToPower(number, CountDigits(number))) // Postcondition: The result is true if the number is equal to the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits, otherwise false
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `number >= 0`: Armstrong numbers are defined for non-negative integers, so the input must satisfy this condition.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`)**:
   - `res == (number == SumOfDigitsRaisedToPower(number, CountDigits(number)))`: The result `res` is `true` if the number is equal to the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits (which is the definition of an Armstrong number). Otherwise, `res` is `false`.

### Notes:
- `SumOfDigitsRaisedToPower(number, CountDigits(number))` is a conceptual function that calculates the sum of the digits of `number`, each raised to the power of the number of digits in `number`.
- `CountDigits(number)` is a conceptual function that returns the number of digits in `number`.

You would need to implement these helper functions (`SumOfDigitsRaisedToPower` and `CountDigits`) to complete the method.
