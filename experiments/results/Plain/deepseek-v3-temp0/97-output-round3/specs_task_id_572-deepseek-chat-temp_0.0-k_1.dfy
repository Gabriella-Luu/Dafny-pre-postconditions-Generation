Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed for the task of removing duplicate numbers from a given integer array:

```dafny
method twoUniqueNums(nums: array<int>) returns (res: array<int>)
  requires nums != null // The input array must not be null
  ensures res != null // The result array must not be null
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < res.Length ==> res[i] != res[j] // All elements in the result array are unique
  ensures forall x :: x in nums ==> x in res // Every element in the input array is present in the result array
  ensures forall x :: x in res ==> x in nums // Every element in the result array is from the input array
  ensures res.Length <= nums.Length // The result array is no longer than the input array
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation of Preconditions and Postconditions:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `nums != null`: Ensures the input array is not null, as working with a null array would lead to runtime errors.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - `res != null`: Ensures the result array is not null.
   - `forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < res.Length ==> res[i] != res[j]`: Ensures all elements in the result array are unique (no duplicates).
   - `forall x :: x in nums ==> x in res`: Ensures every element in the input array is present in the result array (no elements are lost).
   - `forall x :: x in res ==> x in nums`: Ensures every element in the result array is from the input array (no extra elements are added).
   - `res.Length <= nums.Length`: Ensures the result array is no longer than the input array, as removing duplicates cannot increase the size.

These conditions collectively ensure the correctness of the method in removing duplicates while preserving the original elements.
