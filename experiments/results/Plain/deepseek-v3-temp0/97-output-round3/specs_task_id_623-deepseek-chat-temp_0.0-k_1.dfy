Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method nthNums(list: seq<int>, n: int) returns (res: seq<int>)
  // Preconditions
  requires n >= 0; // The exponent n must be non-negative to avoid fractional results or undefined behavior
  ensures |res| == |list|; // The resulting sequence has the same length as the input sequence
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |list| ==> res[i] == Power(list[i], n); // Each element in the result is the n-th power of the corresponding element in the input list
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`)**:
   - `n >= 0`: Ensures the exponent is non-negative. Negative exponents would result in fractional values, which are not handled by the `int` type in Dafny.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `|res| == |list|`: Ensures the resulting sequence has the same length as the input sequence.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |list| ==> res[i] == Power(list[i], n)`: Ensures that each element in the result sequence is the n-th power of the corresponding element in the input sequence. Here, `Power` is a hypothetical function representing exponentiation.

This specification ensures the method behaves correctly according to the task description.
