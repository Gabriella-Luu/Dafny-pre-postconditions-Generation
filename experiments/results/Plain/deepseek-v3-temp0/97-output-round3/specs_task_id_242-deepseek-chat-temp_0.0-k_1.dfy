Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions for counting the total number of characters in a string:

```dafny
method countCharacter(str: string) returns (res: int)
  // Precondition: The input string must not be null.
  requires str != null
  // Postcondition: The result is the length of the input string.
  ensures res == |str|
{
  // Implementation is omitted as per the task description.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `str != null`: Ensures that the input string is not null. This is necessary to avoid null reference errors when accessing the string's properties or methods.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`)**:
   - `res == |str|`: Ensures that the result (`res`) is equal to the length of the input string (`|str|`). In Dafny, `|str|` represents the length of the string `str`.

This specification guarantees that the method correctly counts the number of characters in the string, provided the input is valid.
