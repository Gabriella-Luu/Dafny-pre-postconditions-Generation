Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method removeElements(list1: array<int>, list2: array<int>) returns (res: array<int>)
  requires list1 != null && list2 != null // Both input arrays must be non-null
  ensures res != null // The result array must be non-null
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < res.Length ==> !(exists j :: 0 <= j < list2.Length && res[i] == list2[j]) // No element in res is present in list2
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < list1.Length ==> (exists j :: 0 <= j < res.Length && list1[i] == res[j]) || (exists k :: 0 <= k < list2.Length && list1[i] == list2[k]) // Every element in list1 is either in res or in list2
  ensures res.Length <= list1.Length // The length of res is at most the length of list1
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation of Preconditions and Postconditions:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `list1 != null && list2 != null`: Ensures that both input arrays are non-null to avoid null reference errors.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - `res != null`: Ensures that the returned array is non-null.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < res.Length ==> !(exists j :: 0 <= j < list2.Length && res[i] == list2[j])`: Ensures that no element in the result array `res` is present in `list2`.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < list1.Length ==> (exists j :: 0 <= j < res.Length && list1[i] == res[j]) || (exists k :: 0 <= k < list2.Length && list1[i] == list2[k])`: Ensures that every element in `list1` is either in `res` or in `list2`.
   - `res.Length <= list1.Length`: Ensures that the length of `res` is at most the length of `list1`, as elements are being removed.

This specification ensures the correctness of the method by clearly defining the expected behavior and constraints.
