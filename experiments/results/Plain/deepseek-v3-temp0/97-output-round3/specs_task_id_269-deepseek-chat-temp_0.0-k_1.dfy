Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions for finding the ASCII value of a character:

```dafny
method asciiValue(ch: char) returns (res: int)
  // Precondition: The input character must be a valid ASCII character.
  requires ch <= '\x7F'
  // Postcondition: The result is the ASCII value of the input character.
  ensures res == ch as int
{
  // Implementation is omitted for this task.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - The input character `ch` must be a valid ASCII character. ASCII characters have values in the range `0x00` to `0x7F` (0 to 127 in decimal). The precondition ensures that the input character is within this range.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`)**:
   - The result `res` is the ASCII value of the input character `ch`. In Dafny, casting a `char` to an `int` directly gives its ASCII value, so the postcondition ensures that `res` equals the integer representation of `ch`.

This design ensures that the method is correct and verifiable in Dafny.
