Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed based on the task description:

```dafny
method sumOfCommonDivisor(a: int, b: int) returns (res: int)
  requires a > 0 && b > 0 // Precondition: Both inputs must be positive integers
  ensures res >= 1 // Postcondition: The result is at least 1 (since 1 is a common divisor of any two numbers)
  ensures res <= a && res <= b // Postcondition: The result cannot exceed the smaller of the two input numbers
  ensures a % res == 0 && b % res == 0 // Postcondition: The result is a common divisor of both a and b
  ensures forall d: int :: d > 0 && a % d == 0 && b % d == 0 ==> d <= res // Postcondition: The result is the sum of all common divisors
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`)**:
   - `a > 0 && b > 0`: Ensures that both input numbers are positive integers, as divisors are only meaningful for positive numbers.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `res >= 1`: The sum of common divisors must be at least 1, since 1 is a common divisor of any two positive integers.
   - `res <= a && res <= b`: The sum of common divisors cannot exceed the smaller of the two input numbers.
   - `a % res == 0 && b % res == 0`: Ensures that the result is a common divisor of both `a` and `b`.
   - `forall d: int :: d > 0 && a % d == 0 && b % d == 0 ==> d <= res`: Ensures that the result is the sum of all common divisors of `a` and `b`.

This design ensures that the method is correct and verifiable in Dafny.
