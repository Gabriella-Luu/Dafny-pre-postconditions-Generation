Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed based on the task description:

```dafny
method IsSublist(sub: seq<int>, main: seq<int>) returns (result: bool)
  // Preconditions
  requires |sub| <= |main|; // The sublist cannot be longer than the main list
  // Postconditions
  ensures result == (exists i :: 0 <= i <= |main| - |sub| && sub == main[i..i+|sub|]);
  // The result is true if and only if the sublist exists as a contiguous sequence in the main list
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `|sub| <= |main|`: The length of the sublist must be less than or equal to the length of the main list. This ensures that the sublist can logically be a part of the main list.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`)**:
   - `result == (exists i :: 0 <= i <= |main| - |sub| && sub == main[i..i+|sub|])`: The result is `true` if and only if there exists an index `i` in the main list such that the sublist is equal to the contiguous sequence of elements in the main list starting at index `i` and of length `|sub|`.

This design ensures that the method correctly verifies whether `sub` is a sublist of `main`.
