Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method oddSplit(arr: array<int>) returns (oddList: seq<int>)
  requires arr != null // The input array must not be null
  ensures |oddList| <= arr.Length // The length of the oddList is at most the length of the input array
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |oddList| ==> oddList[i] % 2 == 1 // Every element in oddList is odd
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < arr.Length && arr[i] % 2 == 1 ==> exists j :: 0 <= j < |oddList| && oddList[j] == arr[i] // Every odd element in the input array is included in oddList
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `arr != null`: Ensures the input array is not null to avoid null reference errors.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `|oddList| <= arr.Length`: Ensures the length of the resulting sequence `oddList` is at most the length of the input array, as it only contains a subset of the elements.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |oddList| ==> oddList[i] % 2 == 1`: Ensures every element in `oddList` is odd.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < arr.Length && arr[i] % 2 == 1 ==> exists j :: 0 <= j < |oddList| && oddList[j] == arr[i]`: Ensures that every odd element in the input array `arr` is included in the resulting sequence `oddList`.

This specification ensures the method behaves correctly according to the task description.
