Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method surfaceArea(baseEdge: int, height: int) returns (area: int)
  // Preconditions: baseEdge and height must be positive
  requires baseEdge > 0
  requires height > 0
  // Postcondition: area is the correct surface area of a square pyramid
  ensures area == baseEdge * baseEdge + 2 * baseEdge * Math.Sqrt((baseEdge * baseEdge) / 4 + height * height)
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `baseEdge > 0`: The base edge of the pyramid must be a positive integer.
   - `height > 0`: The height of the pyramid must also be a positive integer.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`):**
   - The `area` returned is the correct surface area of a square pyramid, calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{area} = \text{baseEdge}^2 + 2 \cdot \text{baseEdge} \cdot \sqrt{\left(\frac{\text{baseEdge}^2}{4} + \text{height}^2\right)}
     \]
   - This ensures the method computes the surface area correctly based on the given inputs.
