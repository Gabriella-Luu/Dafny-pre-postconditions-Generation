Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method closestNum(n: int) returns (res: int)
  // Precondition: n must be greater than the smallest possible integer
  requires n > int.MinValue
  // Postcondition: The result res is the closest smaller number than n
  ensures res == n - 1
{
  // Implementation is omitted
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`):**
   - `n > int.MinValue`: This ensures that `n` is not the smallest possible integer. If `n` were `int.MinValue`, there would be no valid smaller integer, so this precondition guarantees that `n - 1` is a valid integer.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`):**
   - `res == n - 1`: This ensures that the result `res` is exactly one less than `n`, which is the closest smaller number.

This design ensures that the method is well-defined and meets the requirements of the task.
