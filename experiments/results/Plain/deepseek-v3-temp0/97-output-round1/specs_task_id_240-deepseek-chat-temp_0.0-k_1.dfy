Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method replaceList(first: seq<int>, second: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
  requires |first| > 0  // The first list must not be empty (to have a last element to replace)
  ensures |result| == |first| - 1 + |second|  // The length of the result is the length of the first list minus 1 (removed last element) plus the length of the second list
  ensures result == first[..|first|-1] + second  // The result is the first list without its last element, concatenated with the second list
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `|first| > 0`: Ensures the first list is not empty, as there must be a last element to replace.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `|result| == |first| - 1 + |second|`: Ensures the length of the resulting list is correct. It removes the last element of the first list (`|first| - 1`) and appends the entire second list (`|second|`).
   - `result == first[..|first|-1] + second`: Ensures the result is the first list without its last element (`first[..|first|-1]`) concatenated with the second list (`second`).

This specification ensures the method behaves as intended and verifies the correctness of the program.
