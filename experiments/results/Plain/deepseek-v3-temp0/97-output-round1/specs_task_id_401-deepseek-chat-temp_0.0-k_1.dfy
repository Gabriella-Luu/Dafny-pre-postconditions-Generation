Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed based on the task description:

```dafny
method addNestedSequence(a: seq<seq<int>>, b: seq<seq<int>>) returns (result: seq<seq<int>>)
  // Preconditions
  requires |a| == |b|; // The outer sequences must have the same length
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |a| ==> |a[i]| == |b[i]|; // Each inner sequence must have the same length
  // Postconditions
  ensures |result| == |a|; // The result has the same outer length as the input sequences
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |a| ==> |result[i]| == |a[i]|; // Each inner sequence in the result has the same length as the input sequences
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < |a| && 0 <= j < |a[i]| ==> result[i][j] == a[i][j] + b[i][j]; // Each element in the result is the sum of the corresponding elements in a and b
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `|a| == |b|`: Ensures that the two input sequences `a` and `b` have the same outer length.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |a| ==> |a[i]| == |b[i]|`: Ensures that for each index `i`, the inner sequences `a[i]` and `b[i]` have the same length.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - `|result| == |a|`: Ensures that the result sequence has the same outer length as the input sequences.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |a| ==> |result[i]| == |a[i]|`: Ensures that each inner sequence in the result has the same length as the corresponding inner sequences in the input.
   - `forall i, j :: 0 <= i < |a| && 0 <= j < |a[i]| ==> result[i][j] == a[i][j] + b[i][j]`: Ensures that each element in the result is the sum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.

These conditions ensure that the method performs index-wise addition correctly and that the result is well-formed.
