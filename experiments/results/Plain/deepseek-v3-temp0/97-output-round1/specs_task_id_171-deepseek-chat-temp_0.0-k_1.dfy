Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method perimeterPentagon(a: int) returns (res: int)
  // Precondition: The side length must be a positive integer.
  requires a > 0
  // Postcondition: The result is the perimeter of a regular pentagon, which is 5 times the side length.
  ensures res == 5 * a
{
  // Implementation is omitted for now.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`):**
   - The side length `a` must be a positive integer (`a > 0`). This ensures that the input is valid for calculating the perimeter of a regular pentagon.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`):**
   - The result `res` must be equal to `5 * a`, which is the formula for the perimeter of a regular pentagon (since a regular pentagon has 5 equal sides).

This design ensures that the method is correct and verifiable in Dafny.
