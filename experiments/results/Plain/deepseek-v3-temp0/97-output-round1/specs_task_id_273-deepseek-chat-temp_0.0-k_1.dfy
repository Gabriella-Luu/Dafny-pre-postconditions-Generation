Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method substractElements(s1: seq<int>, s2: seq<int>) returns (res: seq<int>)
  // Preconditions
  requires |s1| == |s2|; // The sequences must have the same length
  // Postconditions
  ensures |res| == |s1|; // The result sequence has the same length as the input sequences
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |res| ==> res[i] == s1[i] - s2[i]; // Each element in the result is the subtraction of corresponding elements in s1 and s2
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `|s1| == |s2|`: Ensures that the two input sequences have the same length. This is necessary because we are subtracting elements at the same index, and mismatched lengths would lead to undefined behavior.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `|res| == |s1|`: Ensures that the resulting sequence `res` has the same length as the input sequences.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |res| ==> res[i] == s1[i] - s2[i]`: Ensures that each element in the result sequence `res` is the result of subtracting the corresponding elements in `s1` and `s2`.

This specification ensures that the method behaves correctly according to the task description.
