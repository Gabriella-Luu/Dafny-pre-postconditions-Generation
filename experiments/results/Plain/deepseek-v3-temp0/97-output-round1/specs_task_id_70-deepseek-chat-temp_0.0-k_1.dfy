Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed based on the task description:

```dafny
method getEqual(list: seq<seq<int>>) returns (res: bool)
  // Precondition: The input list must not be empty.
  requires |list| > 0
  // Postcondition: The result is true if all sequences in the list have the same length, otherwise false.
  ensures res == (forall i, j :: 0 <= i < |list| && 0 <= j < |list| ==> |list[i]| == |list[j]|)
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - The input `list` must not be empty (`|list| > 0`). This ensures that there is at least one sequence in the list to compare lengths.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`)**:
   - The result `res` is `true` if and only if all sequences in the list have the same length. This is expressed using a universal quantifier (`forall`) to compare the lengths of all pairs of sequences in the list. If any pair of sequences has different lengths, the result will be `false`.

This design ensures that the method is verified to behave correctly according to the task requirements.
