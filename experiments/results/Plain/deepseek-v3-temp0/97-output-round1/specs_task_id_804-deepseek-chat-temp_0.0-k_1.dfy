Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed to verify whether the product of numbers in an array is even or not, without explicitly calculating the product:

```dafny
method isProductEven(arr: array<int>) returns (res: bool)
  requires arr != null // The array must be non-null
  ensures res == exists i :: 0 <= i < arr.Length && arr[i] % 2 == 0 // The result is true if at least one element in the array is even
  ensures !res == forall i :: 0 <= i < arr.Length ==> arr[i] % 2 != 0 // The result is false if all elements in the array are odd
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `arr != null`: Ensures the input array is not null to avoid null reference errors.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `res == exists i :: 0 <= i < arr.Length && arr[i] % 2 == 0`: Ensures that the result `res` is `true` if there exists at least one even number in the array.
   - `!res == forall i :: 0 <= i < arr.Length ==> arr[i] % 2 != 0`: Ensures that the result `res` is `false` if all numbers in the array are odd.

These conditions ensure the correctness of the method without explicitly computing the product.
