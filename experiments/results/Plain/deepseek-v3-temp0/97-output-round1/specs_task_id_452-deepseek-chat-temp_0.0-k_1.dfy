Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method lossAmount(cost: int, sale: int) returns (res: int)
  // Preconditions
  requires cost >= 0 && sale >= 0 // Cost and sale amounts must be non-negative
  // Postconditions
  ensures res == (if sale < cost then cost - sale else 0) // Result is the loss amount if sale < cost, otherwise 0
  ensures res >= 0 // The result is always non-negative
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`)**:
   - `cost >= 0 && sale >= 0`: Ensures that both `cost` and `sale` are non-negative, as negative values for cost or sale do not make sense in this context.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `res == (if sale < cost then cost - sale else 0)`: Specifies that the result `res` is the loss amount (`cost - sale`) if the sale amount is less than the cost, otherwise it is `0`.
   - `res >= 0`: Ensures that the result is always non-negative, as a loss amount cannot be negative.

This design ensures the method behaves correctly according to the task description.
