Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions for finding the maximum of two numbers:

```dafny
method maximum(a: int, b: int) returns (max: int)
  // Preconditions: None needed, as the method works for all integers.
  // Postconditions: The returned value is the maximum of a and b.
  ensures max == a || max == b
  ensures max >= a && max >= b
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`)**: No preconditions are needed because the method works for all integer values of `a` and `b`.
2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - The first postcondition ensures that the returned value `max` is either equal to `a` or equal to `b`.
   - The second postcondition ensures that `max` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, confirming that it is indeed the maximum of the two numbers.
