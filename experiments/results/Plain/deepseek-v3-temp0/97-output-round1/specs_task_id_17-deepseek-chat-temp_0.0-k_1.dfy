Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method squarePerimeter(side: int) returns (res: int)
  // Precondition: The side length of the square must be non-negative.
  requires side >= 0
  // Postcondition: The result is the perimeter of the square, which is 4 times the side length.
  ensures res == 4 * side
{
  // Implementation is omitted as per the request.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`):**  
   The side length of a square cannot be negative, so we enforce `side >= 0` to ensure the input is valid.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`):**  
   The perimeter of a square is calculated as `4 * side`. The postcondition ensures that the result `res` is equal to `4 * side`, guaranteeing the correctness of the method.
