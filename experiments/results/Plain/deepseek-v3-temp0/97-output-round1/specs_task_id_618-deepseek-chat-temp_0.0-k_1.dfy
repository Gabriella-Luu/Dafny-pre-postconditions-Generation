Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions for the task of dividing two lists element-wise:

```dafny
method divList(a: seq<int>, b: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
  requires |a| == |b| // The lengths of the two lists must be equal
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |b| ==> b[i] != 0 // No element in `b` can be zero to avoid division by zero
  ensures |result| == |a| // The length of the result list is the same as the input lists
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |a| ==> result[i] == a[i] / b[i] // Each element in the result is the division of corresponding elements in `a` and `b`
{
  // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `|a| == |b|`: Ensures the two input lists `a` and `b` have the same length, as element-wise division requires matching indices.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |b| ==> b[i] != 0`: Ensures no element in `b` is zero to prevent division by zero errors.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - `|result| == |a|`: Ensures the resulting list has the same length as the input lists.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |a| ==> result[i] == a[i] / b[i]`: Ensures each element in the result list is the division of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.
