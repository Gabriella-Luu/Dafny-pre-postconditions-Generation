Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
// Dafny method without implementation
method isNonagonal(n: int) returns (res: int)
  requires n >= 1 // Precondition: n must be a positive integer (1 or greater)
  ensures res == n * (7 * n - 5) / 2 // Postcondition: res is the nth nonagonal number
{
  // Implementation will go here
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`):**
   - `n >= 1`: The input `n` must be a positive integer because nonagonal numbers are defined for positive integers only.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`):**
   - `res == n * (7 * n - 5) / 2`: The result `res` must equal the nth nonagonal number, which is calculated using the formula for nonagonal numbers: \( \text{res} = \frac{n(7n - 5)}{2} \).

This ensures that the method is verified to compute the correct nth nonagonal number for valid inputs.
