Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method rectangleArea(l: int, b: int) returns (res: int)
  // Preconditions: length and breadth must be non-negative
  requires l >= 0
  requires b >= 0
  // Postcondition: the result is the area of the rectangle
  ensures res == l * b
{
  // Implementation is omitted
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`)**:
   - `l >= 0`: The length of the rectangle must be non-negative.
   - `b >= 0`: The breadth of the rectangle must be non-negative.
   These ensure that the inputs are valid for calculating the area.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`)**:
   - `res == l * b`: The result (`res`) must be equal to the product of the length (`l`) and breadth (`b`), which is the area of the rectangle.

This design ensures that the method is correct and adheres to the mathematical definition of the area of a rectangle.
