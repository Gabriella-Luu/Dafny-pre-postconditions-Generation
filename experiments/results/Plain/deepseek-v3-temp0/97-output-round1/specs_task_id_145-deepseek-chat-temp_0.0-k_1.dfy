Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method maxAbsDiff(arr: array<int>) returns (res: int)
  requires arr != null // The array must not be null
  requires arr.Length >= 2 // The array must have at least two elements to compute a difference
  ensures res >= 0 // The result is non-negative since it's an absolute difference
  ensures exists i, j :: 0 <= i < j < arr.Length && res == |arr[i] - arr[j]| // The result corresponds to the absolute difference of some pair in the array
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < arr.Length ==> res >= |arr[i] - arr[j]| // The result is the maximum absolute difference among all pairs
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `arr != null`: Ensures the array is not null.
   - `arr.Length >= 2`: Ensures the array has at least two elements, as a difference cannot be computed with fewer than two elements.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - `res >= 0`: Ensures the result is non-negative since it represents an absolute difference.
   - `exists i, j :: 0 <= i < j < arr.Length && res == |arr[i] - arr[j]|`: Ensures the result corresponds to the absolute difference of some pair in the array.
   - `forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < arr.Length ==> res >= |arr[i] - arr[j]|`: Ensures the result is the maximum absolute difference among all pairs in the array.

This specification ensures the method is correct and verifiable in Dafny.
