Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed based on the task description:

```dafny
method extract(list: seq<seq<int>>) returns (res: seq<int>)
  // Precondition: The input list must not be empty, and all sublists must also not be empty.
  requires |list| > 0
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |list| ==> |list[i]| > 0
  // Postcondition: The result sequence has the same length as the input list.
  ensures |res| == |list|
  // Postcondition: Each element in the result sequence is the first element of the corresponding sublist.
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |list| ==> res[i] == list[i][0]
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `|list| > 0`: Ensures the input list is not empty.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |list| ==> |list[i]| > 0`: Ensures that every sublist in the input list is not empty.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - `|res| == |list|`: Ensures the result sequence has the same length as the input list.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |list| ==> res[i] == list[i][0]`: Ensures that each element in the result sequence is the first element of the corresponding sublist in the input list.

This design ensures the method behaves correctly and verifies the requirements described in the task.
