Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
// Dafny method without implementation
method checkMonthnumbNumber(m: int) returns (res: bool)
  requires 1 <= m <= 12 // Precondition: Month number must be between 1 and 12
  ensures res == (m == 1 || m == 3 || m == 5 || m == 7 || m == 8 || m == 10 || m == 12) // Postcondition: res is true if the month has 31 days, false otherwise
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - The input `m` must be a valid month number, i.e., between 1 and 12 (inclusive). This ensures the method only operates on valid month numbers.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`)**:
   - The result `res` is `true` if the month number corresponds to a month with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, or December). Otherwise, `res` is `false`.

This design ensures the method is both safe (handles only valid inputs) and correct (produces the expected result based on the input).
