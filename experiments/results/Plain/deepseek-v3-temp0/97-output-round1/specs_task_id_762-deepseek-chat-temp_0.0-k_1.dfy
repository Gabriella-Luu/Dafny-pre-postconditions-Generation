Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method checkMonthnumberNumber(monthnum: int) returns (res: bool)
  // Precondition: The input month number must be between 1 and 12 (inclusive).
  requires 1 <= monthnum <= 12
  // Postcondition: The result is true if the month has 30 days, otherwise false.
  ensures res == (monthnum == 4 || monthnum == 6 || monthnum == 9 || monthnum == 11)
{
  // Implementation is omitted as per the request.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - The input `monthnum` must be a valid month number, i.e., between 1 and 12 (inclusive). This ensures the method only operates on valid inputs.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`)**:
   - The result `res` is `true` if the month number corresponds to a month with 30 days (April, June, September, or November). Otherwise, `res` is `false`.

This design ensures the method is both safe (due to the precondition) and correct (due to the postcondition).
