Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions for finding the nth octagonal number:

```dafny
method isOctagonal(n: int) returns (res: int)
  // Precondition: n must be a non-negative integer
  requires n >= 0
  // Postcondition: res is the nth octagonal number, calculated using the formula 3n^2 - 2n
  ensures res == 3 * n * n - 2 * n
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`):**
   - The input `n` must be a non-negative integer (`n >= 0`) because octagonal numbers are defined for non-negative integers.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`):**
   - The result `res` must satisfy the formula for the nth octagonal number, which is `3n^2 - 2n`. This ensures the correctness of the method.

This design ensures that the method adheres to the mathematical definition of octagonal numbers and verifies its correctness using Dafny's verification capabilities.
