Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method leftRotate(n: bv32, d: int) returns (r: bv32)
  // Preconditions:
  // - The number of bits to rotate (d) must be non-negative.
  // - The number of bits to rotate (d) must be less than or equal to 32, since the number is a 32-bit vector.
  requires 0 <= d <= 32
  // Postconditions:
  // - The result (r) is the bitwise left rotation of n by d bits.
  // - The rotation wraps around, meaning bits shifted off the left end are reintroduced on the right end.
  ensures r == ((n << d) | (n >> (32 - d))) & 0xFFFFFFFF
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `0 <= d <= 32`: Ensures that the number of bits to rotate (`d`) is within the valid range for a 32-bit vector. A negative rotation doesn't make sense, and rotating more than 32 bits would wrap around and be equivalent to rotating `d % 32` bits.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - `r == ((n << d) | (n >> (32 - d))) & 0xFFFFFFFF`: Specifies that the result `r` is the bitwise left rotation of `n` by `d` bits. The expression `(n << d)` shifts `n` left by `d` bits, and `(n >> (32 - d))` shifts `n` right by `32 - d` bits. The `|` operator combines these two results, and the `& 0xFFFFFFFF` ensures the result is a 32-bit vector by masking out any higher bits.

This design ensures the correctness of the `leftRotate` method by clearly defining its behavior and constraints.
