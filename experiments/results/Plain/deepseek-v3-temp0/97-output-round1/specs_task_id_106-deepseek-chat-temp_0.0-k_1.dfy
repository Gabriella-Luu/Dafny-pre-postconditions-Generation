Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method addLists(s: seq<int>, a: array<int>) returns (r: seq<int>)
  requires a != null // Precondition: The array `a` must not be null.
  ensures r == s + a[..] // Postcondition: The result `r` is the concatenation of the sequence `s` and the elements of the array `a`.
  ensures |r| == |s| + a.Length // Postcondition: The length of the result `r` is the sum of the length of `s` and the length of the array `a`.
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `a != null`: Ensures that the input array `a` is not null, as dereferencing a null array would lead to runtime errors.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `r == s + a[..]`: Ensures that the result `r` is the concatenation of the sequence `s` and all elements of the array `a` (using `a[..]` to convert the array to a sequence).
   - `|r| == |s| + a.Length`: Ensures that the length of the resulting sequence `r` is the sum of the lengths of `s` and the array `a`.

This specification ensures the correctness of the method by defining what the method must achieve and under what conditions it operates.
