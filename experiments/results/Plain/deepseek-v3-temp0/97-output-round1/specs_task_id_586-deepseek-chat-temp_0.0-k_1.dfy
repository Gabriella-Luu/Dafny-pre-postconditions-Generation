Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method splitArr(l: seq<int>, n: int) returns (part: seq<int>)
  // Preconditions
  requires 0 <= n <= |l| // Ensure n is a valid index within the bounds of the list
  // Postconditions
  ensures |part| == |l| // The returned list has the same length as the input list
  ensures part == l[n..] + l[..n] // The returned list is the concatenation of the second part and the first part
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`)**:
   - `0 <= n <= |l|`: Ensures that `n` is a valid index within the bounds of the list `l`. This guarantees that the split operation is well-defined.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `|part| == |l|`: Ensures that the returned list `part` has the same length as the input list `l`.
   - `part == l[n..] + l[..n]`: Ensures that the returned list is the concatenation of the second part of the list (from index `n` to the end) and the first part of the list (from the start to index `n`).

This specification ensures that the method behaves as expected and adheres to the task requirements.
