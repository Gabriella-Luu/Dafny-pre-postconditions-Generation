Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed based on the task description:

```dafny
method checkK(s1: seq<int>, K: int) returns (res: bool)
  // Precondition: The sequence s1 is not null (Dafny implicitly ensures this, so no explicit precondition is needed).
  // Postcondition: The result res is true if and only if K is an element of the sequence s1.
  ensures res == (K in s1)
{
  // Implementation is omitted as per the task.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions**: No explicit precondition is needed because Dafny ensures that the sequence `s1` is not null by default. If additional constraints were required (e.g., `s1` must be non-empty), they could be added as `requires` clauses.
2. **Postcondition**: The postcondition ensures that the result `res` is `true` if and only if `K` is an element of the sequence `s1`. This is expressed using the `in` operator in Dafny, which checks for membership in a sequence.

This design ensures the correctness of the method by clearly specifying the relationship between the input and output.
