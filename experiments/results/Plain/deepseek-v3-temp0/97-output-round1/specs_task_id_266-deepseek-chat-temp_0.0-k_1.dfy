Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method lateralsurfaceCube(l: int) returns (res: int)
  // Precondition: The side length of the cube must be non-negative.
  requires l >= 0
  // Postcondition: The result is the lateral surface area of the cube, which is 4 times the square of the side length.
  ensures res == 4 * l * l
{
  // Implementation is omitted as per the request.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`):**
   - The side length `l` must be non-negative (`l >= 0`) because a negative side length does not make sense in the context of a physical cube.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`):**
   - The result `res` must equal the lateral surface area of the cube, which is calculated as `4 * l * l`. This ensures the correctness of the method's output.

This design ensures that the method is both safe (no invalid inputs) and correct (produces the expected result).
