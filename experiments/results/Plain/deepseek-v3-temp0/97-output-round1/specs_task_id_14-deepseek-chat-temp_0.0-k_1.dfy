Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method findVolume(base: int, height: int, length: int) returns (volume: int)
  // Preconditions: base, height, and length must be positive integers
  requires base > 0
  requires height > 0
  requires length > 0
  // Postcondition: volume is the correct volume of the triangular prism
  ensures volume == (base * height * length) / 2
{
  // Implementation is omitted
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `base > 0`, `height > 0`, and `length > 0`: These ensure that the input dimensions are valid (positive integers) since negative or zero values do not make sense for geometric dimensions.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`):**
   - `volume == (base * height * length) / 2`: This ensures that the returned volume is correctly calculated as the volume of a triangular prism, which is given by the formula \((base \times height \times length) / 2\).

This design ensures that the method is both safe (handles valid inputs) and correct (produces the expected result).
