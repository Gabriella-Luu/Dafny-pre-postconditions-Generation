Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed based on the task description:

```dafny
method findMinLength(list: seq<seq<int>>) returns (res: int)
  // Precondition: The input list of lists must not be empty.
  requires |list| > 0
  // Postcondition 1: The result `res` is the length of one of the lists in `list`.
  ensures exists i :: 0 <= i < |list| && res == |list[i]|
  // Postcondition 2: The result `res` is the smallest length among all lists in `list`.
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |list| ==> res <= |list[i]|
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - The input `list` must not be empty (`|list| > 0`). This ensures that there is at least one list in the sequence to find the minimum length.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - **Postcondition 1**: The result `res` is the length of one of the lists in `list`. This ensures that `res` corresponds to the length of an actual list in the sequence.
   - **Postcondition 2**: The result `res` is the smallest length among all lists in `list`. This ensures that `res` is indeed the minimum length.

These conditions help verify the correctness of the method by ensuring it behaves as expected for valid inputs.
