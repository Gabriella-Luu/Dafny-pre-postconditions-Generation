Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions for the task of creating a deep copy of a sequence:

```dafny
method deepCloneSequence(s1: seq<int>) returns (res: seq<int>)
  // Precondition: None, as the method should work for any input sequence.
  ensures |res| == |s1| // The length of the result sequence is the same as the input sequence.
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |s1| ==> res[i] == s1[i] // Every element in the result sequence matches the corresponding element in the input sequence.
  ensures res != s1 // The result sequence is a new sequence, not the same as the input sequence (ensures deep copy).
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**: There is no precondition because the method should work for any input sequence, including an empty sequence.
2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `|res| == |s1|`: Ensures the length of the result sequence `res` is the same as the input sequence `s1`.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |s1| ==> res[i] == s1[i]`: Ensures that every element in the result sequence matches the corresponding element in the input sequence.
   - `res != s1`: Ensures that the result sequence is a new sequence, not the same as the input sequence, guaranteeing a deep copy.
