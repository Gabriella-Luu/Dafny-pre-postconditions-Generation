Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method difference(n: int) returns (diff: int)
  // Precondition: n must be a non-negative integer
  requires n >= 0
  // Postcondition: diff is the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers
  ensures diff == (n * (n + 1) / 2) * (n * (n + 1) / 2) - (n * (n + 1) / 2)
{
  // Implementation will go here
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `n >= 0`: The input `n` must be a non-negative integer because the task involves summing the first `n` natural numbers, which are defined for non-negative integers.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`)**:
   - The postcondition ensures that `diff` is the difference between the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
   - The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is given by the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`.
   - The sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers is given by the square of the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, i.e., `(n * (n + 1) / 2) * (n * (n + 1) / 2)`.
   - Therefore, the difference is calculated as `(n * (n + 1) / 2) * (n * (n + 1) / 2) - (n * (n + 1) / 2)`.

This ensures the correctness of the method by specifying the expected relationship between the input and output.
