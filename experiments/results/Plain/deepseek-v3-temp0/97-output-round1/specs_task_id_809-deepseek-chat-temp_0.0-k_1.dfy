Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method checkSmaller(s1: seq<int>, s2: seq<int>) returns (res: bool)
  // Preconditions
  requires |s1| == |s2|; // The sequences must have the same length
  // Postconditions
  ensures res == (forall i :: 0 <= i < |s1| ==> s2[i] < s1[i]); // Result is true if every element in s2 is smaller than the corresponding element in s1
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `|s1| == |s2|`: Ensures that the two sequences have the same length. This is necessary because we are comparing corresponding elements.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`)**:
   - `res == (forall i :: 0 <= i < |s1| ==> s2[i] < s1[i])`: Ensures that the result `res` is `true` if and only if every element in `s2` is smaller than the corresponding element in `s1`. The `forall` quantifier checks this condition for all valid indices `i` in the sequences.
