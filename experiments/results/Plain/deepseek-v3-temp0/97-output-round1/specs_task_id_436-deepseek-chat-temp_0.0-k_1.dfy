Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method negNos(list1: array<int>) returns (res: array<int>)
  requires list1 != null // Precondition: The input array must not be null.
  ensures res != null // Postcondition: The result array must not be null.
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < res.Length ==> res[i] < 0 // Postcondition: All elements in the result array are negative.
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < list1.Length && list1[i] < 0 ==> exists j :: 0 <= j < res.Length && res[j] == list1[i] // Postcondition: Every negative number in the input array is included in the result array.
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < res.Length ==> exists j :: 0 <= j < list1.Length && res[i] == list1[j] // Postcondition: Every element in the result array comes from the input array.
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `list1 != null`: Ensures the input array is not null to avoid null reference errors.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `res != null`: Ensures the returned array is not null.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < res.Length ==> res[i] < 0`: Ensures all elements in the result array are negative.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < list1.Length && list1[i] < 0 ==> exists j :: 0 <= j < res.Length && res[j] == list1[i]`: Ensures every negative number in the input array is included in the result array.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < res.Length ==> exists j :: 0 <= j < list1.Length && res[i] == list1[j]`: Ensures every element in the result array comes from the input array.

These conditions collectively ensure the correctness of the method in extracting negative numbers from the input array.
