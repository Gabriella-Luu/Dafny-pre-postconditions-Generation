Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method checkChar(str: string) returns (res: bool)
  // Precondition: The input string must not be empty.
  requires |str| > 0
  // Postcondition: The result is true if the first and last characters of the string are the same, otherwise false.
  ensures res == (str[0] == str[|str| - 1])
{
  // Implementation is omitted as per the request.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - The string `str` must not be empty (`|str| > 0`). This ensures that the method can safely access the first and last characters of the string without causing an out-of-bounds error.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`)**:
   - The result `res` is `true` if the first character (`str[0]`) and the last character (`str[|str| - 1]`) of the string are the same. Otherwise, `res` is `false`.

This design ensures that the method behaves correctly and verifiably according to the task requirements.
