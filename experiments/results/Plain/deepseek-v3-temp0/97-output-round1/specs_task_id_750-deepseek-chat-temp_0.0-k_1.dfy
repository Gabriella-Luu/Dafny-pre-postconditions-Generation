Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method addTuple(l: seq<(int, int)>, t: (int, int)) returns (r: seq<(int, int)>)
  // Precondition: The input list `l` is a valid sequence of tuples.
  requires |l| >= 0
  // Postcondition: The returned sequence `r` is the result of appending `t` to `l`.
  ensures r == l + [t]
  // Postcondition: The length of `r` is one more than the length of `l`.
  ensures |r| == |l| + 1
  // Postcondition: The last element of `r` is the tuple `t`.
  ensures r[|r| - 1] == t
  // Postcondition: All elements of `l` are preserved in `r` in the same order.
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |l| ==> r[i] == l[i]
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `|l| >= 0`: Ensures the input sequence `l` is valid (sequences in Dafny always have a non-negative length).

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `r == l + [t]`: Ensures the returned sequence `r` is the result of appending the tuple `t` to the sequence `l`.
   - `|r| == |l| + 1`: Ensures the length of `r` is exactly one more than the length of `l`.
   - `r[|r| - 1] == t`: Ensures the last element of `r` is the tuple `t`.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |l| ==> r[i] == l[i]`: Ensures all elements of `l` are preserved in `r` in the same order.

This design ensures the method behaves as expected and verifies its correctness.
