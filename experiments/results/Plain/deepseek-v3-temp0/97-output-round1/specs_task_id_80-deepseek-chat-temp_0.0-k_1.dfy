Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions for finding the nth tetrahedral number:

```dafny
method tetrahedralNumber(n: int) returns (res: int)
  // Precondition: n must be a non-negative integer because tetrahedral numbers are defined for n >= 0.
  requires n >= 0
  // Postcondition: The result res is the nth tetrahedral number, which is the sum of the first n triangular numbers.
  // The nth tetrahedral number is given by the formula: res = n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 6
  ensures res == n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 6
{
  // Implementation is omitted as per the task description.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`):**
   - The input `n` must be a non-negative integer (`n >= 0`) because tetrahedral numbers are only defined for non-negative integers.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`):**
   - The result `res` must satisfy the formula for the nth tetrahedral number: `res == n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 6`. This ensures the correctness of the method by verifying that the returned value matches the mathematical definition of a tetrahedral number.
