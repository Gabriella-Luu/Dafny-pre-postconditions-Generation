Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method overlapping(list1: seq<int>, list2: seq<int>) returns (res: bool)
  // Preconditions: None, as the method should work for any input sequences.
  // Postconditions: The result `res` is true if and only if there exists at least one element in `list1` that is also in `list2`.
  ensures res == (exists x :: x in list1 && x in list2)
{
  // Implementation is omitted as per the request.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`)**: There are no preconditions because the method should handle any input sequences, including empty sequences.
2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**: The postcondition ensures that the result `res` is `true` if and only if there exists at least one element `x` that is present in both `list1` and `list2`. This is expressed using the Dafny existential quantifier (`exists`).

This design ensures the correctness of the method by clearly specifying the relationship between the input sequences and the output boolean value.
