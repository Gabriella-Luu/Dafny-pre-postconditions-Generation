Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method nthNums(list: seq<int>, n: int) returns (res: seq<int>)
  // Preconditions:
  // 1. The input list must be non-empty.
  // 2. The exponent `n` must be non-negative to avoid fractional results or undefined behavior.
  requires |list| > 0
  requires n >= 0
  // Postconditions:
  // 1. The length of the result sequence `res` must match the length of the input sequence `list`.
  // 2. Each element in `res` must be the n-th power of the corresponding element in `list`.
  ensures |res| == |list|
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |list| ==> res[i] == Power(list[i], n)
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `|list| > 0`: Ensures the input list is non-empty to avoid edge cases with empty sequences.
   - `n >= 0`: Ensures the exponent `n` is non-negative to avoid fractional or undefined results (e.g., negative exponents or complex numbers).

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - `|res| == |list|`: Ensures the result sequence `res` has the same length as the input sequence `list`.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |list| ==> res[i] == Power(list[i], n)`: Ensures each element in `res` is the n-th power of the corresponding element in `list`. Here, `Power` is a hypothetical function representing exponentiation.

This design ensures the method is correct and verifiable in Dafny.
