Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method surfaceArea(baseEdge: int, height: int) returns (area: int)
  // Preconditions: baseEdge and height must be positive values
  requires baseEdge > 0
  requires height > 0
  // Postcondition: area is the correct surface area of a square pyramid
  ensures area == baseEdge * baseEdge + 2 * baseEdge * Math.Sqrt((baseEdge * baseEdge) / 4 + height * height
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `baseEdge > 0`: The base edge of the pyramid must be a positive value since a pyramid cannot have a non-positive base edge.
   - `height > 0`: The height of the pyramid must also be a positive value for the same reason.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`):**
   - The surface area of a square pyramid is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{area} = \text{baseEdge}^2 + 2 \cdot \text{baseEdge} \cdot \sqrt{\left(\frac{\text{baseEdge}}{2}\right)^2 + \text{height}^2}
     \]
   - The postcondition ensures that the returned `area` matches this formula.

This design ensures that the method is verified for correctness with respect to the given requirements.
