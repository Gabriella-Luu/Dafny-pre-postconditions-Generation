Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method arrayToSequence(arr: array<int>) returns (res: seq<int>)
  requires arr != null // Precondition: The input array must not be null
  ensures |res| == arr.Length // Postcondition: The length of the resulting sequence equals the length of the input array
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < arr.Length ==> res[i] == arr[i] // Postcondition: Each element in the sequence matches the corresponding element in the array
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `arr != null`: Ensures the input array is not null, as dereferencing a null array would lead to errors.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `|res| == arr.Length`: Ensures the length of the resulting sequence `res` is equal to the length of the input array `arr`.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < arr.Length ==> res[i] == arr[i]`: Ensures that every element in the sequence `res` at index `i` matches the corresponding element in the array `arr` at the same index.

These conditions ensure the correctness of the method by verifying that the conversion from an array to a sequence preserves both the length and the elements of the input array.
