Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method countList(list: seq<seq<int>>) returns (res: int)
  // Precondition: The input sequence of lists is valid (no null lists or invalid sequences).
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |list| ==> list[i] != []
  // Postcondition: The result `res` is equal to the number of lists in the input sequence.
  ensures res == |list|
{
  // Implementation is omitted as per the request.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - The input `list` is a sequence of sequences of integers (`seq<seq<int>>`).
   - The precondition ensures that no element in the sequence `list` is an empty list (`list[i] != []`). This is optional and can be adjusted based on specific requirements. If empty lists are allowed, this precondition can be removed.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`)**:
   - The result `res` is equal to the length of the input sequence `list` (`|list|`), which represents the number of lists in the sequence.

This design ensures that the method correctly counts the number of lists in the input sequence and verifies its correctness using Dafny's verification tools.
