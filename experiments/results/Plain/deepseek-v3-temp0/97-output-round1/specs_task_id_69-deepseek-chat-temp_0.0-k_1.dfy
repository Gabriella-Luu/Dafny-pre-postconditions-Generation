Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method isSublist(list: seq<seq<int>>, sub: seq<int>) returns (res: bool)
  // Preconditions
  requires |list| >= 0  // The list of sequences is non-negative in length (always true for Dafny sequences)
  requires |sub| >= 0   // The subsequence is non-negative in length (always true for Dafny sequences)
  // Postconditions
  ensures res == (exists i :: 0 <= i < |list| && list[i] == sub)  // res is true if and only if sub is an element of list
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `|list| >= 0`: Ensures the length of the list of sequences is non-negative (this is always true in Dafny, but included for clarity).
   - `|sub| >= 0`: Ensures the length of the subsequence is non-negative (also always true in Dafny).

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - `res == (exists i :: 0 <= i < |list| && list[i] == sub)`: Ensures that the result `res` is `true` if and only if there exists an index `i` such that `list[i]` is equal to `sub`. This captures the requirement that the method checks whether `sub` is an element of `list`.

This design ensures the method is verified to correctly determine whether `sub` is contained in `list`.
