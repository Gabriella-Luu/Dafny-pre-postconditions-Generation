Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions for finding the nth decagonal number:

```dafny
// Dafny method without implementation
method isNumDecagonal(n: int) returns (res: int)
  // Precondition: n must be a non-negative integer
  requires n >= 0
  // Postcondition: res is the nth decagonal number, calculated using the formula 4n^2 - 3n
  ensures res == 4 * n * n - 3 * n
{
  // Implementation will go here
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`):**
   - The input `n` must be a non-negative integer (`n >= 0`) because decagonal numbers are defined for non-negative integers.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`):**
   - The result `res` must satisfy the formula for the nth decagonal number, which is `4n^2 - 3n`. This ensures the correctness of the method.

This design ensures that the method is both safe (due to the precondition) and correct (due to the postcondition).
