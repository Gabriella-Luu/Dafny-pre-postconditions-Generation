Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method countCharacter(str: string) returns (res: int)
  // Precondition: The input string must not be null.
  requires str != null
  // Postcondition: The result is the length of the input string.
  ensures res == |str|
{
  // Implementation is omitted as per the request.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `str != null`: Ensures that the input string is not null. This is necessary because Dafny strings are reference types, and null strings could lead to runtime errors.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`)**:
   - `res == |str|`: Ensures that the result `res` is equal to the length of the input string `str`. The notation `|str|` represents the length of the string in Dafny.

This design ensures that the method is correct and verifiable in Dafny.
