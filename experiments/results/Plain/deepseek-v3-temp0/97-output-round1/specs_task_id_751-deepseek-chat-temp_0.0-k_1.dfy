Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed to check if the given array represents a min heap:

```dafny
method checkMinHeap(arr1: array<int>) returns (res: bool)
  requires arr1 != null // The array must not be null
  requires arr1.Length >= 0 // The array can be empty or have elements
  ensures res == (forall i :: 0 <= i < arr1.Length ==> 
    (2*i + 1 >= arr1.Length || arr1[i] <= arr1[2*i + 1]) && 
    (2*i + 2 >= arr1.Length || arr1[i] <= arr1[2*i + 2])) // The result is true if the array satisfies the min heap property
  ensures res == (forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < arr1.Length && (j == 2*i + 1 || j == 2*i + 2) ==> arr1[i] <= arr1[j]) // Alternative postcondition for clarity
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `arr1 != null`: Ensures the array is not null.
   - `arr1.Length >= 0`: Allows the array to be empty or contain elements.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - The first postcondition ensures that `res` is `true` if and only if the array satisfies the min heap property. Specifically, for every index `i`, the element at `i` is less than or equal to its left child (`2*i + 1`) and right child (`2*i + 2`), if they exist.
   - The second postcondition is an alternative formulation for clarity, stating that for every pair of indices `i` and `j` where `j` is a child of `i`, the element at `i` is less than or equal to the element at `j`.

This design ensures the method is verified to correctly check the min heap property of the array.
