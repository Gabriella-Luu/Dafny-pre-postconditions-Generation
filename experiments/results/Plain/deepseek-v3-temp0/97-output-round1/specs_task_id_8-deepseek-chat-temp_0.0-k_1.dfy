Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed based on the task description:

```dafny
method squareNums(nums: array<int>) returns (out: array<int>)
  requires nums != null // Precondition: The input array must not be null.
  ensures out != null // Postcondition: The output array must not be null.
  ensures out.Length == nums.Length // Postcondition: The output array must have the same length as the input array.
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < nums.Length ==> out[i] == nums[i] * nums[i] // Postcondition: Each element in the output array is the square of the corresponding element in the input array.
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires nums != null`)**:
   - Ensures that the input array `nums` is not null, as operating on a null array would lead to runtime errors.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `out != null`: Ensures that the returned array `out` is not null.
   - `out.Length == nums.Length`: Ensures that the output array has the same length as the input array.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < nums.Length ==> out[i] == nums[i] * nums[i]`: Ensures that each element in the output array is the square of the corresponding element in the input array.

These conditions help verify the correctness of the method by ensuring that the output array is properly constructed and contains the squared values of the input array.
