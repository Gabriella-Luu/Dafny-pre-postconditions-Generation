Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed for the task:

```dafny
method bitwiseXOR(sq1: seq<bv32>, sq2: seq<bv32>) returns (res: seq<bv32>)
  // Preconditions
  requires |sq1| == |sq2|; // The two sequences must have the same length
  // Postconditions
  ensures |res| == |sq1|; // The result sequence has the same length as the input sequences
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |res| ==> res[i] == sq1[i] ^ sq2[i]; // Each element in the result is the bitwise XOR of the corresponding elements in the input sequences
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`)**:
   - `|sq1| == |sq2|`: The two input sequences `sq1` and `sq2` must have the same length. This ensures that the bitwise XOR operation can be applied element-wise without mismatches.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `|res| == |sq1|`: The resulting sequence `res` must have the same length as the input sequences.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |res| ==> res[i] == sq1[i] ^ sq2[i]`: Every element in the result sequence `res` must be the bitwise XOR of the corresponding elements in `sq1` and `sq2`. This ensures the correctness of the bitwise XOR operation.

This design ensures that the method behaves as expected and adheres to the requirements of the task.
