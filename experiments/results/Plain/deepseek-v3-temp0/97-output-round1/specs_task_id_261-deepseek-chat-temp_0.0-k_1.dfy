Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method divisionElements(test_tup1: seq<int>, test_tup2: seq<int>) returns (res: seq<int>)
  // Preconditions
  requires |test_tup1| == |test_tup2|; // The sequences must have the same length
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |test_tup2| ==> test_tup2[i] != 0; // No element in the second sequence can be zero (to avoid division by zero)
  // Postconditions
  ensures |res| == |test_tup1|; // The result sequence has the same length as the input sequences
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |res| ==> res[i] == test_tup1[i] / test_tup2[i]; // Each element in the result is the division of corresponding elements in the input sequences
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - The sequences `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` must have the same length (`|test_tup1| == |test_tup2|`).
   - No element in `test_tup2` can be zero (`forall i :: 0 <= i < |test_tup2| ==> test_tup2[i] != 0`) to prevent division by zero.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - The result sequence `res` has the same length as the input sequences (`|res| == |test_tup1|`).
   - Each element in `res` is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` (`forall i :: 0 <= i < |res| ==> res[i] == test_tup1[i] / test_tup2[i]`).

This ensures the method is correct and safe to use for element-wise division of sequences.
