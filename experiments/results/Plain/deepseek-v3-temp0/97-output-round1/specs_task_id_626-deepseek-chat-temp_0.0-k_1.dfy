Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method triangleArea(r: int) returns (res: int)
  // Precondition: The radius must be a positive integer.
  requires r > 0
  // Postcondition: The result is the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle of radius r.
  ensures res == (r * r) // The area of the largest triangle inscribed in a semicircle is r^2.
{
  // Implementation is omitted for now.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - The radius `r` must be a positive integer (`r > 0`). This ensures the input is valid for geometric calculations.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`)**:
   - The result `res` is the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle of radius `r`. The largest such triangle is a right-angled triangle with its base as the diameter of the semicircle and its height equal to the radius. The area of this triangle is `(r * r)`.

This design ensures the method is both correct and verifiable in Dafny.
