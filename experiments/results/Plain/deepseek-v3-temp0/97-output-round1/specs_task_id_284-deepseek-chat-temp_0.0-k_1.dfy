Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method checkElement(a1: array<int>, e: int) returns (res: bool)
  requires a1 != null // Precondition: The input array must not be null.
  ensures res == (forall i :: 0 <= i < a1.Length ==> a1[i] == e) // Postcondition: The result is true if and only if all elements in the array are equal to `e`.
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `a1 != null`: Ensures that the input array is not null, as accessing a null array would lead to runtime errors.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`)**:
   - `res == (forall i :: 0 <= i < a1.Length ==> a1[i] == e)`: Ensures that the result `res` is `true` if and only if every element in the array `a1` is equal to the given element `e`. The `forall` quantifier checks all indices `i` in the range of the array's length.
