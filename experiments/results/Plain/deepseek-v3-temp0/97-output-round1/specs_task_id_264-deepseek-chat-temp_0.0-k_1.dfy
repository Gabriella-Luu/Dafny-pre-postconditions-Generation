Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method dogAge(hAge: int) returns (res: int)
  // Preconditions
  requires hAge >= 0; // Human age must be non-negative
  // Postconditions
  ensures res == if hAge <= 2 then hAge * 10 else 20 + (hAge - 2) * 4; // Dog's age calculation
  ensures res >= 0; // Dog's age must be non-negative
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `hAge >= 0`: The human age (`hAge`) must be non-negative because age cannot be negative.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `res == if hAge <= 2 then hAge * 10 else 20 + (hAge - 2) * 4`: This ensures the dog's age is calculated correctly based on the given formula. For the first two years, each human year counts as 10 dog years. After that, each human year counts as 4 dog years.
   - `res >= 0`: Ensures the result (dog's age) is non-negative, which is a logical requirement for age.

This design ensures the method is correct and adheres to the requirements.
