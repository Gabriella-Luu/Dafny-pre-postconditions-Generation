Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method evenPosition(list: seq<int>) returns (res: bool)
  // Precondition: The list must not be null (though Dafny sequences are always non-null, this is implicit).
  // No additional preconditions are needed since the method works for any sequence of integers.
  ensures res == (forall i :: 0 <= i < |list| && i % 2 == 0 ==> list[i] % 2 == 0)
  // Postcondition: The result `res` is true if and only if every even index in the list contains an even number.
{
  // Implementation is omitted as per the task.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions**: No explicit preconditions are required because the method is designed to work for any sequence of integers. Dafny sequences are always non-null, so no null-check is needed.
2. **Postcondition**: The `ensures` clause specifies that the result `res` is `true` if and only if for every index `i` in the sequence where `i` is even (`i % 2 == 0`), the element at that index (`list[i]`) is also even (`list[i] % 2 == 0`). This ensures the correctness of the method based on the task description.

This design ensures that the method is verified to meet the requirements.
