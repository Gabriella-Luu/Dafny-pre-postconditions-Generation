Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed based on the task description:

```dafny
method maxLength(list1: seq<seq<int>>) returns (max: seq<int>)
  // Precondition: The input list of lists must not be empty.
  requires |list1| > 0
  // Postcondition 1: The returned list `max` is one of the lists in `list1`.
  ensures max in list1
  // Postcondition 2: The length of `max` is greater than or equal to the length of every list in `list1`.
  ensures forall lst :: lst in list1 ==> |max| >= |lst|
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires |list1| > 0`)**:
   - Ensures that the input `list1` is not empty. This is necessary because finding the maximum length list in an empty list of lists is undefined.

2. **Postcondition 1 (`ensures max in list1`)**:
   - Ensures that the returned list `max` is one of the lists in the input `list1`. This guarantees that the result is valid and comes from the input.

3. **Postcondition 2 (`ensures forall lst :: lst in list1 ==> |max| >= |lst|`)**:
   - Ensures that the length of `max` is greater than or equal to the length of every list in `list1`. This guarantees that `max` is indeed the list with the maximum length.

This design ensures the correctness of the method by clearly specifying the requirements and guarantees.
