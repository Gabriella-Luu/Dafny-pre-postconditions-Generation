Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method addPairwise(a: array<int>) returns (result: array<int>)
  requires a != null && a.Length >= 2 // Precondition: The input array must not be null and must have at least 2 elements
  ensures result != null // Postcondition: The result array is not null
  ensures result.Length == a.Length - 1 // Postcondition: The result array has one fewer element than the input array
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < result.Length ==> result[i] == a[i] + a[i + 1] // Postcondition: Each element in the result array is the sum of neighboring elements in the input array
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `a != null`: Ensures the input array is not null.
   - `a.Length >= 2`: Ensures the input array has at least 2 elements, as pairwise addition requires at least two elements to operate.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - `result != null`: Ensures the returned array is not null.
   - `result.Length == a.Length - 1`: Ensures the result array has one fewer element than the input array, as pairwise addition reduces the sequence length by 1.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < result.Length ==> result[i] == a[i] + a[i + 1]`: Ensures each element in the result array is the sum of the corresponding neighboring elements in the input array.

This specification ensures the method behaves correctly according to the task description.
