Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed based on the task description:

```dafny
method stringToChar(str: string) returns (res: seq<char>)
  // Precondition: The input string must not be null.
  requires str != null
  // Postcondition 1: The length of the resulting sequence of characters is equal to the length of the input string.
  ensures |res| == |str|
  // Postcondition 2: Each character in the resulting sequence corresponds to the character at the same position in the input string.
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |str| ==> res[i] == str[i]
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires str != null`)**:
   - Ensures that the input string is not null, as converting a null string to a sequence of characters is not meaningful.

2. **Postcondition 1 (`ensures |res| == |str|`)**:
   - Ensures that the length of the resulting sequence of characters (`res`) is equal to the length of the input string (`str`).

3. **Postcondition 2 (`ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |str| ==> res[i] == str[i]`)**:
   - Ensures that every character in the resulting sequence (`res`) matches the corresponding character in the input string (`str`) at the same position.

These conditions collectively ensure that the method correctly converts the input string into a sequence of characters while maintaining the integrity of the data.
