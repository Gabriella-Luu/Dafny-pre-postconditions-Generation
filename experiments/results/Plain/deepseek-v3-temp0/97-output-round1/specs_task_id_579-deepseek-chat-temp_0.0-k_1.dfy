Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method DissimilarElements(a: array<int>, b: array<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
  requires a != null && b != null // Both input arrays must be non-null
  ensures |result| <= |a| + |b| // The result sequence cannot be larger than the combined size of the two arrays
  ensures forall x :: x in result ==> (x in a[..] && x !in b[..]) || (x in b[..] && x !in a[..]) // Every element in the result is in one array but not the other
  ensures forall x :: (x in a[..] && x !in b[..]) || (x in b[..] && x !in a[..]) ==> x in result // Every element that is in one array but not the other is included in the result
{
  // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`)**:
   - `a != null && b != null`: Ensures that the input arrays `a` and `b` are not null, as working with null arrays would lead to runtime errors.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `|result| <= |a| + |b|`: Ensures that the size of the result sequence is at most the sum of the sizes of the two input arrays. This is because the result cannot contain more elements than the total number of elements in both arrays.
   - `forall x :: x in result ==> (x in a[..] && x !in b[..]) || (x in b[..] && x !in a[..])`: Ensures that every element in the result sequence is present in one array but not the other.
   - `forall x :: (x in a[..] && x !in b[..]) || (x in b[..] && x !in a[..]) ==> x in result`: Ensures that every element that is in one array but not the other is included in the result sequence. This guarantees that no dissimilar element is missed.

This specification ensures that the method correctly identifies and returns all dissimilar elements between the two arrays.
