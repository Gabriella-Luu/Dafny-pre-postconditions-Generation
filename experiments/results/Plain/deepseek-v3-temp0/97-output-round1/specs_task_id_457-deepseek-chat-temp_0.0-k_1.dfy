Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed based on the task description:

```dafny
method findMin(list: seq<seq<int>>) returns (res: seq<int>)
  // Precondition: The input list must not be empty.
  requires |list| > 0
  // Postcondition 1: The result `res` is one of the sublists in `list`.
  ensures res in list
  // Postcondition 2: The length of `res` is less than or equal to the length of every sublist in `list`.
  ensures forall sublist :: sublist in list ==> |res| <= |sublist|
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires |list| > 0`):**  
   The input `list` must not be empty because finding the minimum-length sublist in an empty list is undefined.

2. **Postcondition 1 (`ensures res in list`):**  
   The result `res` must be one of the sublists in the input `list`. This ensures that the method returns a valid sublist from the input.

3. **Postcondition 2 (`ensures forall sublist :: sublist in list ==> |res| <= |sublist|`):**  
   The length of `res` must be less than or equal to the length of every sublist in `list`. This ensures that `res` is indeed the sublist with the minimum length.

This design ensures the correctness of the method by specifying clear constraints on the input and output.
