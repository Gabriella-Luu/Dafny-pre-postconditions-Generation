Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method indexMinimum(list: array<seq<int>>) returns (res: int)
  requires list != null // The input array must not be null
  requires list.Length > 0 // The array must not be empty
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < list.Length ==> list[i] != null && list[i].Length >= 2 // Each sequence in the array must not be null and must have at least 2 elements
  ensures 0 <= res < list.Length // The result is a valid index in the array
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < list.Length ==> list[i][1] >= list[res][1] // The second value of the sequence at the result index is the smallest among all sequences
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `list != null`: Ensures the input array is not null.
   - `list.Length > 0`: Ensures the array is not empty.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < list.Length ==> list[i] != null && list[i].Length >= 2`: Ensures every sequence in the array is not null and has at least 2 elements (so that the second value exists).

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - `0 <= res < list.Length`: Ensures the returned index is valid for the array.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < list.Length ==> list[i][1] >= list[res][1]`: Ensures the second value of the sequence at the returned index is the smallest among all sequences in the array.
