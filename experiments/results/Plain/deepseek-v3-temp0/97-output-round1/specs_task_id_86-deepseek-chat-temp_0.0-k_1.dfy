Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions for finding the nth centered hexagonal number:

```dafny
method centeredHexagonalNumber(n: int) returns (res: int)
  // Precondition: n must be a non-negative integer
  requires n >= 0
  // Postcondition: res is the nth centered hexagonal number, which is calculated as 3n(n + 1) + 1
  ensures res == 3 * n * (n + 1) + 1
{
  // Implementation is omitted
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`):**
   - The input `n` must be a non-negative integer (`n >= 0`) because centered hexagonal numbers are defined for non-negative integers only.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`):**
   - The result `res` must satisfy the formula for the nth centered hexagonal number, which is `3 * n * (n + 1) + 1`. This ensures the correctness of the computed result.

This design ensures that the method is verified to compute the correct centered hexagonal number for valid inputs.
