Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method insertElement(list: seq<string>, element: string) returns (res: seq<string>)
  // Preconditions: None needed, as the method should work for any input list and element.
  // Postconditions: The resulting list `res` should have the `element` inserted before each element of `list`.
  ensures |res| == |list| * 2
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |list| ==> res[2*i] == element && res[2*i + 1] == list[i]
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions**: No preconditions are needed because the method should work for any input sequence `list` and any string `element`.
2. **Postconditions**:
   - The length of the resulting list `res` must be twice the length of the input list `list` because we are inserting one element before each existing element.
   - For every index `i` in the input list, the element at position `2*i` in `res` must be the `element`, and the element at position `2*i + 1` must be the corresponding element from the input list `list`.

This ensures the correctness of the method by specifying the expected structure of the output list.
