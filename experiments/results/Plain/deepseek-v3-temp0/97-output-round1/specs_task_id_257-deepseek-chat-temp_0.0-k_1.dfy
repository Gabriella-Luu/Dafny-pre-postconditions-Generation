Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method swapNumbers(a: int, b: int) returns (res: seq<int>)
  // Preconditions: None needed since the method works for all integers.
  // Postconditions: The result sequence must contain the second number followed by the first number.
  ensures |res| == 2
  ensures res[0] == b && res[1] == a
{
  // Implementation is omitted as per the task.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`)**: None are needed because the method is designed to work for any two integers `a` and `b`. There are no restrictions on the input values.
2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - The length of the resulting sequence `res` must be exactly 2 (`|res| == 2`).
   - The first element of the sequence must be `b`, and the second element must be `a` (`res[0] == b && res[1] == a`).
   
These postconditions ensure that the method correctly swaps the two input numbers and returns them in a sequence.
