Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method countSubstrings(str: string) returns (res: int)
  // Preconditions
  requires str != null; // The input string must not be null
  // Postconditions
  ensures res >= 0; // The result is a non-negative integer
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i <= j < |str| && sumDigits(str[i..j+1]) == j - i + 1 ==> res > 0;
  // Ensures that for every valid substring str[i..j+1], if the sum of its digits equals its length, then the result is positive
  ensures res == |{ i, j | 0 <= i <= j < |str| && sumDigits(str[i..j+1]) == j - i + 1 }|;
  // Ensures that the result is equal to the number of substrings where the sum of digits equals their length
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`)**:
   - `str != null`: Ensures the input string is not null, as null strings are invalid for this operation.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `res >= 0`: Ensures the result is a non-negative integer, as the count of substrings cannot be negative.
   - The second postcondition ensures that for every valid substring `str[i..j+1]`, if the sum of its digits equals its length, then the result `res` is positive.
   - The third postcondition ensures that `res` is equal to the exact number of substrings where the sum of digits equals their length. This is expressed using a set comprehension to count all valid pairs `(i, j)`.

### Notes:
- The function `sumDigits` is assumed to compute the sum of the digits in a substring. This function would need to be defined separately.
- The notation `str[i..j+1]` represents the substring from index `i` to `j` (inclusive).
- The postconditions are designed to ensure the correctness of the method by explicitly stating the properties that must hold for the result.
