Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
// Dafny method without implementation
method volumeCube(l: int) returns (res: int)
  // Precondition: The side length of the cube must be non-negative.
  requires l >= 0
  // Postcondition: The result is the volume of the cube, which is the cube of the side length.
  ensures res == l * l * l
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires l >= 0`)**: The side length of a cube cannot be negative, as it represents a physical dimension. This ensures the input is valid.
2. **Postcondition (`ensures res == l * l * l`)**: The volume of a cube is calculated as the cube of its side length. This ensures the method computes the correct result.
