Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method sumOfCommonDivisor(a: int, b: int) returns (res: int)
  // Preconditions
  requires a > 0 && b > 0; // Both inputs must be positive integers
  // Postconditions
  ensures res >= 1; // The sum of common divisors is at least 1 (since 1 is a common divisor of any two positive integers)
  ensures res == (sum d | 1 <= d <= a && 1 <= d <= b && a % d == 0 && b % d == 0 :: d); // The result is the sum of all common divisors of a and b
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`)**:
   - `a > 0 && b > 0`: Ensures that both input numbers are positive integers. This is necessary because divisors are only defined for positive integers.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `res >= 1`: Ensures that the result is at least 1, since 1 is always a common divisor of any two positive integers.
   - `res == (sum d | 1 <= d <= a && 1 <= d <= b && a % d == 0 && b % d == 0 :: d)`: Ensures that the result is the sum of all integers `d` that are divisors of both `a` and `b`. This is the formal definition of the sum of common divisors.

This specification ensures that the method correctly computes the sum of common divisors of the two input numbers.
