Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions for checking whether a specified array is sorted:

```dafny
method IsSorted(a: array<int>) returns (sorted: bool)
  requires a != null // The array must not be null
  ensures sorted == (forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < a.Length ==> a[i] <= a[j]) // The result is true if and only if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order
  ensures sorted == (forall i :: 0 <= i < a.Length - 1 ==> a[i] <= a[i + 1]) // Alternative postcondition: the result is true if and only if each element is less than or equal to the next
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `a != null`: Ensures that the input array is not null, as dereferencing a null array would lead to errors.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `sorted == (forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < a.Length ==> a[i] <= a[j])`: The method returns `true` if and only if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is expressed by stating that for all pairs of indices `i` and `j` where `i < j`, the element at `i` is less than or equal to the element at `j`.
   - `sorted == (forall i :: 0 <= i < a.Length - 1 ==> a[i] <= a[i + 1])`: An alternative postcondition that checks if each element is less than or equal to the next element in the array. This is equivalent to the first postcondition but expressed in a slightly different way.

These preconditions and postconditions ensure that the method is well-defined and that its correctness can be verified.
