Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method sumList(a: seq<int>, b: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
  // Preconditions:
  requires |a| == |b|; // The lengths of the input lists must be equal
  // Postconditions:
  ensures |result| == |a|; // The length of the result list is equal to the length of the input lists
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |a| ==> result[i] == a[i] + b[i]; // Each element in the result list is the sum of the corresponding elements in the input lists
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `|a| == |b|`: Ensures that the two input sequences `a` and `b` have the same length. This is necessary because we cannot add elements from sequences of different lengths.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `|result| == |a|`: Ensures that the resulting sequence has the same length as the input sequences.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |a| ==> result[i] == a[i] + b[i]`: Ensures that each element in the result sequence is the sum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.

This specification ensures that the method behaves correctly according to the task description.
