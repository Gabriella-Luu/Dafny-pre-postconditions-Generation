Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions for finding the nth decagonal number:

```dafny
// Dafny method without implementation
method isNumDecagonal(n: int) returns (res: int)
  requires n >= 1 // Precondition: n must be a positive integer (decagonal numbers are defined for n >= 1)
  ensures res == 4 * n * n - 3 * n // Postcondition: The result is the nth decagonal number, calculated using the formula 4n^2 - 3n
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`):**
   - The input `n` must be a positive integer (`n >= 1`) because decagonal numbers are only defined for positive integers.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`):**
   - The result `res` must satisfy the formula for the nth decagonal number, which is `4n^2 - 3n`. This ensures the correctness of the method's output.

This design ensures that the method is both safe (by restricting invalid inputs) and correct (by guaranteeing the output matches the mathematical definition of decagonal numbers).
