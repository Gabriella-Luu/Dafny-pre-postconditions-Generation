Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method countSubstrings(str: string) returns (res: int)
  // Preconditions
  requires str != null; // The input string must not be null
  // Postconditions
  ensures res >= 0; // The result must be a non-negative integer
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i <= j < |str| && sumDigits(str[i..j+1]) == j - i + 1 ==> res > 0; // Ensures that for every valid substring where the sum of digits equals its length, the result is positive
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i <= j < |str| && sumDigits(str[i..j+1]) != j - i + 1 ==> res == 0 || exists k, l :: 0 <= k <= l < |str| && sumDigits(str[k..l+1]) == l - k + 1; // Ensures that if no such substring exists, the result is 0
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`)**:
   - `str != null`: Ensures the input string is not null, as null strings are invalid for processing.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `res >= 0`: Ensures the result is a non-negative integer, as the count of substrings cannot be negative.
   - The second `ensures` clause ensures that for every valid substring where the sum of digits equals its length, the result is positive.
   - The third `ensures` clause ensures that if no such substring exists, the result is 0, or there exists at least one valid substring.

### Notes:
- The `sumDigits` function is assumed to be a helper function that calculates the sum of digits in a substring. It is not implemented here but is necessary for the logic.
- The substring notation `str[i..j+1]` is used to represent the substring from index `i` to `j` (inclusive).
- The postconditions are designed to capture the correctness of the method based on the task requirements.
