Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed to verify whether a list (`sub`) is a sublist of another list (`main`):

```dafny
method IsSublist(sub: seq<int>, main: seq<int>) returns (result: bool)
  // Preconditions
  requires |sub| <= |main|; // The length of `sub` must be less than or equal to the length of `main`
  // Postconditions
  ensures result == (exists i :: 0 <= i <= |main| - |sub| && main[i..i+|sub|] == sub);
  // The result is true if and only if there exists a starting index `i` in `main` such that
  // the subsequence of `main` starting at `i` with length `|sub|` equals `sub`.
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `|sub| <= |main|`: The length of `sub` must be less than or equal to the length of `main`. This ensures that `sub` can potentially be a sublist of `main`.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`)**:
   - `result == (exists i :: 0 <= i <= |main| - |sub| && main[i..i+|sub|] == sub)`: The result is `true` if and only if there exists an index `i` in `main` such that the subsequence of `main` starting at `i` with length `|sub|` is equal to `sub`. This ensures the correctness of the method by defining what it means for `sub` to be a sublist of `main`.

This design ensures that the method is both safe (due to the precondition) and correct (due to the postcondition).
