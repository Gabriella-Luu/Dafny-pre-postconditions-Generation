Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method findMinLength(list: seq<seq<int>>) returns (res: int)
  // Precondition: The input list of lists must not be empty.
  requires |list| > 0
  // Precondition: All inner lists must have a non-negative length.
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |list| ==> |list[i]| >= 0
  // Postcondition: The result is the length of the smallest list in the input.
  ensures res == (min i | 0 <= i < |list| :: |list[i]|)
  // Postcondition: The result is non-negative.
  ensures res >= 0
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `|list| > 0`: Ensures the input list of lists is not empty. This is necessary because finding the minimum length of an empty list of lists is undefined.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |list| ==> |list[i]| >= 0`: Ensures that all inner lists have a non-negative length. This is a general sanity check, as lengths of lists are always non-negative in Dafny.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - `res == (min i | 0 <= i < |list| :: |list[i]|)`: Ensures that the result `res` is the minimum length among all the inner lists.
   - `res >= 0`: Ensures that the result is non-negative, which is a logical consequence of the preconditions and the nature of list lengths.

This specification ensures the correctness of the method in finding the length of the smallest list in a list of lists.
