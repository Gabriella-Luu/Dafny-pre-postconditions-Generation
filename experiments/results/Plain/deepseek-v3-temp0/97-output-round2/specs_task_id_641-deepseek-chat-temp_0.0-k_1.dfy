Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method isNonagonal(n: int) returns (res: int)
  // Precondition: n must be a non-negative integer because nonagonal numbers are defined for n >= 0.
  requires n >= 0
  // Postcondition: The result is the nth nonagonal number, which is calculated using the formula res = n * (7 * n - 5) / 2.
  ensures res == n * (7 * n - 5) / 2
{
  // Implementation is omitted as per the request.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`):**
   - The input `n` must be a non-negative integer (`n >= 0`) because nonagonal numbers are only defined for non-negative integers.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`):**
   - The result `res` must satisfy the formula for the nth nonagonal number: `res == n * (7 * n - 5) / 2`. This ensures the correctness of the method by verifying that the returned value matches the mathematical definition of a nonagonal number.
