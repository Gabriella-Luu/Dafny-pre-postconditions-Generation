Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method sharedElements(arr1: array<int>, arr2: array<int>) returns (res: seq<int>)
  requires arr1 != null && arr2 != null // Both input arrays must be non-null
  ensures |res| <= |arr1| && |res| <= |arr2| // The result sequence cannot be longer than either input array
  ensures forall x :: x in res ==> x in arr1[..] && x in arr2[..] // Every element in the result must be in both input arrays
  ensures forall x :: x in arr1[..] && x in arr2[..] ==> x in res // Every shared element in the input arrays must be in the result
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`)**:
   - `arr1 != null && arr2 != null`: Ensures that both input arrays are non-null, as working with null arrays would lead to runtime errors.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `|res| <= |arr1| && |res| <= |arr2|`: Ensures that the length of the result sequence `res` is no longer than the length of either input array, as the result can only contain elements present in both arrays.
   - `forall x :: x in res ==> x in arr1[..] && x in arr2[..]`: Ensures that every element in the result sequence `res` is present in both input arrays.
   - `forall x :: x in arr1[..] && x in arr2[..] ==> x in res`: Ensures that every element that is present in both input arrays is included in the result sequence `res`.

These conditions collectively ensure that the method correctly identifies and returns all shared elements between the two input arrays.
