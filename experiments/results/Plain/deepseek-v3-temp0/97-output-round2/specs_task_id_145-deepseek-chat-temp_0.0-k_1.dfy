Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed based on the task description:

```dafny
method maxAbsDiff(arr: array<int>) returns (res: int)
  requires arr.Length > 1 // Precondition: The array must have at least two elements to compute a difference.
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < arr.Length ==> res >= abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) // Postcondition: The result is greater than or equal to the absolute difference of any two elements in the array.
  ensures exists i, j :: 0 <= i < j < arr.Length && res == abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) // Postcondition: The result is equal to the absolute difference of some pair of elements in the array.
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `arr.Length > 1`: The array must contain at least two elements to compute a meaningful difference. If the array has fewer than two elements, the task is undefined.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < arr.Length ==> res >= abs(arr[i] - arr[j])`: The result `res` must be greater than or equal to the absolute difference of any two elements in the array. This ensures that `res` is an upper bound for all possible differences.
   - `exists i, j :: 0 <= i < j < arr.Length && res == abs(arr[i] - arr[j])`: There must exist at least one pair of elements in the array whose absolute difference equals `res`. This ensures that `res` is not just an upper bound but is actually achieved by some pair of elements.

These conditions together ensure that the method correctly computes the maximum absolute difference between any two elements in the array.
