Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed based on the task description:

```dafny
method DissimilarElements(a: array<int>, b: array<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
  // Preconditions
  requires a != null && b != null // Both input arrays must be non-null
  requires a.Length == b.Length    // Both arrays must have the same length
  // Postconditions
  ensures |result| <= a.Length     // The result sequence cannot be longer than the input arrays
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < a.Length ==> 
    (a[i] != b[i] ==> result.Contains(a[i]) || result.Contains(b[i])) // All dissimilar elements are included
  ensures forall x :: x in result ==> 
    (exists i :: 0 <= i < a.Length && (x == a[i] || x == b[i]) && a[i] != b[i]) // Every element in the result is a dissimilar element
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `a != null && b != null`: Ensures that both input arrays are non-null.
   - `a.Length == b.Length`: Ensures that both arrays have the same length, as the task implicitly assumes comparing elements at the same indices.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - `|result| <= a.Length`: Ensures that the resulting sequence of dissimilar elements cannot be longer than the input arrays.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < a.Length ==> (a[i] != b[i] ==> result.Contains(a[i]) || result.Contains(b[i]))`: Ensures that for every index `i`, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are dissimilar, at least one of them is included in the result.
   - `forall x :: x in result ==> (exists i :: 0 <= i < a.Length && (x == a[i] || x == b[i]) && a[i] != b[i])`: Ensures that every element in the result is a dissimilar element from the input arrays.

This design ensures the correctness of the method by specifying what must hold before and after the method executes.
