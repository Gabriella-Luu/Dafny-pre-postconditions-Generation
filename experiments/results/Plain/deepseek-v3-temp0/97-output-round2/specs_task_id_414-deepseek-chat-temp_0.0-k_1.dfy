Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method overlapping(list1: seq<int>, list2: seq<int>) returns (res: bool)
  // Preconditions: None needed, as the method works for any input sequences.
  // Postconditions: The result is true if there exists at least one common element between list1 and list2, otherwise false.
  ensures res == (exists x :: x in list1 && x in list2)
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`)**: No preconditions are needed because the method is designed to work for any input sequences, regardless of their content or length.
2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**: The postcondition ensures that the result `res` is `true` if and only if there exists at least one element `x` that is present in both `list1` and `list2`. This is expressed using the Dafny existential quantifier (`exists`). If no such element exists, the result is `false`.
