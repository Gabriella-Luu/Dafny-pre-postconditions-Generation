Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method getLudic(n: int) returns (lucids: seq<int>)
  // Preconditions
  requires n >= 1
  // Postconditions
  ensures |lucids| >= 1
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |lucids| ==> lucids[i] <= n
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |lucids| ==> isLudic(lucids[i])
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |lucids| ==> lucids[i] < lucids[j]
  ensures forall x :: 1 <= x <= n && isLudic(x) ==> x in lucids
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `n >= 1`: The input integer `n` must be at least 1, as lucid numbers start from 1.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - `|lucids| >= 1`: The sequence `lucids` must contain at least one element (since 1 is always a lucid number).
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |lucids| ==> lucids[i] <= n`: Every element in `lucids` must be less than or equal to `n`.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |lucids| ==> isLudic(lucids[i])`: Every element in `lucids` must be a lucid number (assuming `isLudic` is a predicate that checks if a number is lucid).
   - `forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |lucids| ==> lucids[i] < lucids[j]`: The sequence `lucids` must be strictly increasing.
   - `forall x :: 1 <= x <= n && isLudic(x) ==> x in lucids`: Every lucid number between 1 and `n` must be included in `lucids`.

This ensures the method is correct and meets the requirements of the task.
