Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method volumeCube(l: int) returns (res: int)
  // Precondition: The side length of the cube must be non-negative.
  requires l >= 0
  // Postcondition: The result is the volume of the cube, which is the cube of the side length.
  ensures res == l * l * l
{
  // Implementation is omitted as per the task.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`):**  
   The side length `l` of the cube must be non-negative because a negative side length does not make sense in the context of a physical cube.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`):**  
   The result `res` must be equal to the cube of the side length `l`, which is the mathematical definition of the volume of a cube.

This ensures the method is both safe (no invalid inputs) and correct (produces the expected result).
