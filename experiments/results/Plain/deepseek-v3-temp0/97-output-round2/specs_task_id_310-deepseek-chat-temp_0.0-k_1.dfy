Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method stringToChar(str: string) returns (res: seq<char>)
  // Precondition: The input string must not be null.
  requires str != null
  // Postcondition: The resulting sequence of characters has the same length as the input string.
  ensures |res| == |str|
  // Postcondition: Each character in the resulting sequence matches the corresponding character in the input string.
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |str| ==> res[i] == str[i]
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `str != null`: Ensures the input string is not null, as Dafny strings are reference types and could potentially be null.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `|res| == |str|`: Ensures the length of the resulting sequence of characters (`res`) is equal to the length of the input string (`str`).
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |str| ==> res[i] == str[i]`: Ensures that every character in the resulting sequence (`res`) matches the corresponding character in the input string (`str`). This guarantees the conversion is accurate.

This design ensures the method behaves correctly and verifies the transformation from a string to a sequence of characters.
