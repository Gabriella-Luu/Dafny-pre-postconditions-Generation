Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions for the task of creating a deep copy of a sequence:

```dafny
method deepCloneSequence(s1: seq<int>) returns (res: seq<int>)
  // Precondition: None, as the method should work for any input sequence.
  ensures |res| == |s1| // The length of the result sequence is the same as the input sequence.
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |s1| ==> res[i] == s1[i] // Every element in the result sequence matches the corresponding element in the input sequence.
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`)**: There are no preconditions because the method should work for any input sequence, including an empty sequence.
2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `|res| == |s1|`: Ensures that the length of the resulting sequence `res` is the same as the input sequence `s1`.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |s1| ==> res[i] == s1[i]`: Ensures that every element in the resulting sequence `res` is equal to the corresponding element in the input sequence `s1`. This guarantees that the sequence is a deep copy.

This design ensures that the method produces a correct deep copy of the input sequence.
