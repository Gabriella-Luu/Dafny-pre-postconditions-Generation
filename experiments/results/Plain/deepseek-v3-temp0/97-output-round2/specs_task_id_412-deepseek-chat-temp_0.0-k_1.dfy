Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method removeOdd(arr: array<int>) returns (evenList: seq<int>)
  requires arr != null // The input array must not be null
  ensures |evenList| <= arr.Length // The length of the resulting sequence is at most the length of the input array
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |evenList| ==> evenList[i] % 2 == 0 // All elements in the resulting sequence are even
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < arr.Length && arr[i] % 2 == 0 ==> arr[i] in evenList // Every even element in the input array is included in the resulting sequence
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |evenList| ==> exists j :: 0 <= j < arr.Length && evenList[i] == arr[j] // Every element in the resulting sequence comes from the input array
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation of Preconditions and Postconditions:
1. **Precondition (`requires arr != null`)**:
   - Ensures that the input array `arr` is not null, as operating on a null array would lead to errors.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `|evenList| <= arr.Length`: The length of the resulting sequence `evenList` is at most the length of the input array, as we are only removing elements (not adding any).
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |evenList| ==> evenList[i] % 2 == 0`: Every element in the resulting sequence `evenList` is even.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < arr.Length && arr[i] % 2 == 0 ==> arr[i] in evenList`: Every even element in the input array `arr` is included in the resulting sequence `evenList`.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |evenList| ==> exists j :: 0 <= j < arr.Length && evenList[i] == arr[j]`: Every element in the resulting sequence `evenList` comes from the input array `arr`.

These conditions ensure that the method correctly removes odd numbers from the input array and returns a sequence containing only the even numbers from the original array.
