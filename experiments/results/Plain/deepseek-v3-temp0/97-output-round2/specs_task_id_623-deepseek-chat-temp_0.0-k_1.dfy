Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method nthNums(list: seq<int>, n: int) returns (res: seq<int>)
  // Preconditions
  requires n >= 0; // n must be non-negative to avoid fractional or undefined results
  requires |list| >= 0; // The list can be empty or non-empty
  // Postconditions
  ensures |res| == |list|; // The result list has the same length as the input list
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |list| ==> res[i] == list[i] * list[i] * ... * list[i] (n times); // Each element in res is the n-th power of the corresponding element in list
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `n >= 0`: Ensures that the exponent `n` is non-negative, as negative exponents would result in fractional values, which are not handled in this integer-based method.
   - `|list| >= 0`: Ensures that the input list can be empty or non-empty. This is a trivial condition since all sequences in Dafny have a non-negative length.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - `|res| == |list|`: Ensures that the resulting sequence `res` has the same length as the input sequence `list`.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |list| ==> res[i] == list[i] * list[i] * ... * list[i] (n times)`: Ensures that each element in the resulting sequence `res` is the n-th power of the corresponding element in the input sequence `list`. This is expressed as multiplying the element by itself `n` times.

This specification ensures that the method behaves correctly according to the task description.
