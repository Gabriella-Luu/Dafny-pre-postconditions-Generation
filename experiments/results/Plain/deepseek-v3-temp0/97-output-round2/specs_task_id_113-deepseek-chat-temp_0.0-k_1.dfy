Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method checkInteger(str: string) returns (res: bool)
  // Precondition: The input string must not be null.
  requires str != null
  // Postcondition 1: If the string represents a valid integer, res is true.
  ensures res == true ==> (|str| > 0 && (str[0] == '-' || str[0] == '+' || '0' <= str[0] <= '9') &&
                          (forall i :: 1 <= i < |str| ==> '0' <= str[i] <= '9'))
  // Postcondition 2: If the string does not represent a valid integer, res is false.
  ensures res == false ==> !(|str| > 0 && (str[0] == '-' || str[0] == '+' || '0' <= str[0] <= '9') ||
                           !(forall i :: 1 <= i < |str| ==> '0' <= str[i] <= '9')
{
  // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - The input string `str` must not be null. This ensures the method operates on a valid string.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - **Postcondition 1**: If the string represents a valid integer, `res` is `true`. This means:
     - The string has at least one character (`|str| > 0`).
     - The first character is either a sign (`+` or `-`) or a digit (`0` to `9`).
     - All subsequent characters (if any) are digits (`0` to `9`).
   - **Postcondition 2**: If the string does not represent a valid integer, `res` is `false`. This means:
     - Either the string is empty, or the first character is not a sign or digit, or at least one of the subsequent characters is not a digit.

These conditions ensure the method correctly identifies whether the input string is a valid integer representation.
