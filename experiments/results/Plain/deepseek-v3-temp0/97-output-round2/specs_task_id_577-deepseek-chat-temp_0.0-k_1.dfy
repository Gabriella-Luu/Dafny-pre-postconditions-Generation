Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method lastDigitFactorial(n: int) returns (res: int)
  // Precondition: The input number n must be non-negative.
  requires n >= 0
  // Postcondition: The result res is the factorial of the last digit of n.
  ensures res == factorial(n % 10)
{
  // Implementation is omitted as per the request.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - The input `n` must be non-negative (`n >= 0`) because factorials are defined only for non-negative integers.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`)**:
   - The result `res` is the factorial of the last digit of `n`. The last digit of `n` is obtained using `n % 10`, and `factorial(n % 10)` computes the factorial of that digit.

Note: The `factorial` function is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the program. If it is not already defined, you would need to define it separately. For example:
```dafny
function factorial(x: int): int
  requires x >= 0
{
  if x == 0 then 1 else x * factorial(x - 1)
}
```
