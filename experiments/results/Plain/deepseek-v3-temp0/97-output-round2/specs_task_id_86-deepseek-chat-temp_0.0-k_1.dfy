Certainly! Below is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method centeredHexagonalNumber(n: int) returns (res: int)
  // Precondition: n must be a non-negative integer because the nth centered hexagonal number is defined for n >= 0.
  requires n >= 0
  // Postcondition: The result res is the nth centered hexagonal number, which is calculated by the formula 3n(n + 1) + 1.
  ensures res == 3 * n * (n + 1) + 1
{
  // Implementation will go here
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Precondition (`requires n >= 0`)**: The nth centered hexagonal number is only defined for non-negative integers. Therefore, the input `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.
  
- **Postcondition (`ensures res == 3 * n * (n + 1) + 1`)**: The nth centered hexagonal number is given by the formula \( 3n(n + 1) + 1 \). The postcondition ensures that the result `res` matches this formula.

This setup ensures that the method is both correct and verifiable in Dafny.
