Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method FindEvenNumbers(arr: array<int>) returns (evenList: seq<int>)
  requires arr != null // Precondition: The input array must not be null.
  ensures |evenList| <= arr.Length // Postcondition: The length of the evenList is at most the length of the input array.
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |evenList| ==> evenList[i] % 2 == 0 // Postcondition: All elements in evenList are even numbers.
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < arr.Length && arr[i] % 2 == 0 ==> arr[i] in evenList // Postcondition: Every even number in the input array is included in evenList.
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `arr != null`: Ensures the input array is not null to avoid null reference errors.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `|evenList| <= arr.Length`: Ensures the length of the resulting sequence `evenList` does not exceed the length of the input array.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < |evenList| ==> evenList[i] % 2 == 0`: Ensures every element in `evenList` is an even number.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < arr.Length && arr[i] % 2 == 0 ==> arr[i] in evenList`: Ensures that every even number in the input array is included in `evenList`.

These conditions collectively ensure the correctness of the method in finding even numbers from the input array.
