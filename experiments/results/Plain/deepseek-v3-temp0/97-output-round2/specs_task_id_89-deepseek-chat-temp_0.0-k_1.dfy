Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method closestNum(n: int) returns (res: int)
  // Precondition: n must be greater than the smallest possible integer (to ensure a valid smaller number exists)
  requires n > int.MinValue
  // Postcondition: The result res must be smaller than n
  ensures res < n
  // Postcondition: There is no integer between res and n that is also smaller than n
  ensures forall x :: res < x < n ==> x >= n
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `n > int.MinValue`: Ensures that there exists at least one integer smaller than `n`. If `n` were the smallest possible integer (`int.MinValue`), no valid smaller number would exist.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `res < n`: Ensures that the result `res` is strictly smaller than `n`.
   - `forall x :: res < x < n ==> x >= n`: Ensures that there is no integer `x` between `res` and `n` that is also smaller than `n`. This guarantees that `res` is the closest smaller number to `n`.

This design ensures the correctness of the method by specifying the constraints and expected behavior.
