Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed based on the task description:

```dafny
method FindSmallest(s: array<int>) returns (min: int)
  requires s != null // The array must not be null
  requires s.Length > 0 // The array must have at least one element
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < s.Length ==> min <= s[i] // The returned value is less than or equal to all elements in the array
  ensures exists i :: 0 <= i < s.Length && min == s[i] // The returned value is actually present in the array
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `s != null`: Ensures the array is not null to avoid null reference errors.
   - `s.Length > 0`: Ensures the array has at least one element, as finding the smallest number in an empty array is undefined.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < s.Length ==> min <= s[i]`: Ensures that the returned value `min` is less than or equal to every element in the array.
   - `exists i :: 0 <= i < s.Length && min == s[i]`: Ensures that the returned value `min` is actually present in the array, confirming it is a valid minimum.

These conditions ensure the correctness of the method in finding the smallest number in the array.
