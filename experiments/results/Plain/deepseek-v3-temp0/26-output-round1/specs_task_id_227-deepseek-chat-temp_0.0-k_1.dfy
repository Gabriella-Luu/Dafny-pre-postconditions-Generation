Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions for finding the minimum of three numbers:

```dafny
method MinOfThree(a: int, b: int, c: int) returns (min: int)
  // Preconditions: None needed, as the method works for all integers.
  // Postconditions: The returned value is the minimum of a, b, and c.
  ensures min <= a && min <= b && min <= c
  ensures min == a || min == b || min == c
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`)**: No preconditions are needed because the method is designed to work for all integer inputs.
2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - The first postcondition ensures that the returned value `min` is less than or equal to all three input values (`a`, `b`, and `c`).
   - The second postcondition ensures that `min` is equal to at least one of the input values (`a`, `b`, or `c`), confirming that it is indeed one of the inputs and not an arbitrary smaller value.

These postconditions guarantee that the method correctly identifies the minimum of the three numbers.
