Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method RemoveElement(s: array<int>, k: int) returns (v: array<int>)
  requires s != null // The input array must not be null
  requires 0 <= k < s.Length // k must be a valid index in the array
  ensures v != null // The returned array must not be null
  ensures v.Length == s.Length - 1 // The returned array has one less element
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < k ==> v[i] == s[i] // Elements before k are preserved
  ensures forall i :: k <= i < v.Length ==> v[i] == s[i + 1] // Elements after k are shifted left
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation of Preconditions and Postconditions:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `s != null`: Ensures the input array is not null.
   - `0 <= k < s.Length`: Ensures `k` is a valid index within the bounds of the array.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - `v != null`: Ensures the returned array is not null.
   - `v.Length == s.Length - 1`: Ensures the returned array has one less element than the input array.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < k ==> v[i] == s[i]`: Ensures all elements before index `k` are preserved in the output array.
   - `forall i :: k <= i < v.Length ==> v[i] == s[i + 1]`: Ensures all elements after index `k` are shifted left by one position in the output array.

This specification ensures the method behaves correctly according to the task description.
