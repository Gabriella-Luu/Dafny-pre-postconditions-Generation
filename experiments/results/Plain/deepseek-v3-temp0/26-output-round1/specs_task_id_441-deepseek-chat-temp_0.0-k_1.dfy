Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method CubeSurfaceArea(size: int) returns (area: int)
  // Precondition: The size of the cube must be a non-negative integer.
  requires size >= 0
  // Postcondition: The surface area of the cube is correctly calculated as 6 * size^2.
  ensures area == 6 * size * size
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`):**
   - The size of the cube must be a non-negative integer (`size >= 0`). This ensures that the input is valid for calculating the surface area of a cube.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`):**
   - The surface area of the cube is correctly calculated as `6 * size * size`. This ensures that the method computes the correct surface area based on the given size.

This design ensures that the method is both safe (handles invalid inputs) and correct (produces the expected result).
