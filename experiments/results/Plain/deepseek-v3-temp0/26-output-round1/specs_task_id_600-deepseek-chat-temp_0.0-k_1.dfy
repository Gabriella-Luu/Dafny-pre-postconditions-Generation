Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions for checking whether a given number is even:

```dafny
method IsEven(n: int) returns (result: bool)
  // Precondition: The input number n must be an integer.
  requires n >= 0; // Assuming we are only considering non-negative integers for simplicity.
  // Postcondition: The result is true if n is even, and false otherwise.
  ensures result == (n % 2 == 0);
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `n >= 0`: This ensures that the input number `n` is a non-negative integer. This is optional and depends on the problem's requirements. If negative numbers are allowed, this precondition can be removed.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`)**:
   - `result == (n % 2 == 0)`: This ensures that the returned boolean `result` is `true` if `n` is even (i.e., `n % 2 == 0`), and `false` otherwise.

This specification ensures that the method behaves correctly according to the task description.
