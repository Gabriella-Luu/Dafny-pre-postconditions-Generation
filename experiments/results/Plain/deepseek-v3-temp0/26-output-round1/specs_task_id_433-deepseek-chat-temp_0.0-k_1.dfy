Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method IsGreater(n: int, a: array<int>) returns (result: bool)
  requires a != null // The array must be valid (not null)
  ensures result == (forall i :: 0 <= i < a.Length ==> n > a[i]) // The result is true if and only if n is greater than all elements in the array
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `a != null`: Ensures that the array `a` is a valid array and not null. This is necessary to avoid null reference errors when accessing the array.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`)**:
   - `result == (forall i :: 0 <= i < a.Length ==> n > a[i])`: Ensures that the returned boolean `result` is `true` if and only if `n` is greater than every element in the array `a`. The `forall` quantifier checks that the condition `n > a[i]` holds for all valid indices `i` in the array.

This design ensures that the method is both safe (due to the precondition) and correct (due to the postcondition).
