Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions for finding the minimum of two numbers:

```dafny
method Min(a: int, b: int) returns (minValue: int)
  // Preconditions: None needed, as the method works for all integers.
  // Postconditions: The returned value is the minimum of a and b.
  ensures minValue == a || minValue == b
  ensures minValue <= a && minValue <= b
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`)**: No preconditions are needed because the method works for all integer values of `a` and `b`.
2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - The first postcondition ensures that the returned value `minValue` is either equal to `a` or equal to `b`.
   - The second postcondition ensures that `minValue` is less than or equal to both `a` and `b`, confirming that it is indeed the minimum of the two numbers.
