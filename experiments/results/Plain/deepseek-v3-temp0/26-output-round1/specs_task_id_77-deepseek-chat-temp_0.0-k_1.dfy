Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method IsDivisibleBy11(n: int) returns (result: bool)
  // Precondition: The input number n must be an integer.
  requires n is int;
  // Postcondition: The result is true if and only if n is divisible by 11.
  ensures result == (n % 11 == 0);
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - The input `n` must be an integer. This is implicitly true in Dafny since the type of `n` is already `int`, but it is good practice to explicitly state it for clarity.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`)**:
   - The result is `true` if and only if `n` is divisible by 11. This is expressed using the modulo operator (`%`), where `n % 11 == 0` checks if `n` is divisible by 11.

This ensures that the method behaves correctly and verifies the divisibility condition.
