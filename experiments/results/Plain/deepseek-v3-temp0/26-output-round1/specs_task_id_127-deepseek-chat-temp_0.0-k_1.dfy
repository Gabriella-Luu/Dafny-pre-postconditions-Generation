Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method Multiply(a: int, b: int) returns (result: int)
  // Preconditions: Ensure the inputs are within a reasonable range to avoid overflow
  requires a >= -1000000 && a <= 1000000
  requires b >= -1000000 && b <= 1000000
  // Postcondition: Ensure the result is the correct product of a and b
  ensures result == a * b
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`)**:
   - The inputs `a` and `b` are constrained to a reasonable range (`-1000000` to `1000000`) to avoid potential integer overflow issues. This range can be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the program.
   
2. **Postcondition (`ensures`)**:
   - The result is guaranteed to be the product of `a` and `b`, ensuring the correctness of the multiplication operation.

This design ensures that the method is both safe (by avoiding overflow) and correct (by verifying the result).
