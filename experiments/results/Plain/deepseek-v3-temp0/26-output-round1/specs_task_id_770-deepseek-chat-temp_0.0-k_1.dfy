Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method SumOfFourthPowerOfOddNumbers(n: int) returns (sum: int)
  // Preconditions
  requires n >= 0 // n must be a non-negative integer
  // Postconditions
  ensures sum == (if n == 0 then 0 else sumOfFourthPowers(n)) // sum is the sum of the fourth powers of the first n odd natural numbers
  ensures sum >= 0 // sum is always non-negative
{
  // Implementation is omitted
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`)**:
   - `n >= 0`: The input `n` must be a non-negative integer since we are dealing with the first `n` natural numbers.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `sum == (if n == 0 then 0 else sumOfFourthPowers(n))`: The sum is equal to the sum of the fourth powers of the first `n` odd natural numbers. If `n` is 0, the sum is 0.
   - `sum >= 0`: The sum is always non-negative because the fourth power of any number is non-negative.

The function `sumOfFourthPowers(n)` is a placeholder for the mathematical expression that computes the sum of the fourth powers of the first `n` odd natural numbers. You would need to implement this logic in the method body.
