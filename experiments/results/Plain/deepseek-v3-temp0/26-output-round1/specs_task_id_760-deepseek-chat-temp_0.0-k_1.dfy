Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed based on the task description:

```dafny
method HasOnlyOneDistinctElement(a: array<int>) returns (result: bool)
  // Precondition: The array must not be null.
  requires a != null
  // Postcondition: The result is true if and only if all elements in the array are the same.
  ensures result == (forall i, j :: 0 <= i < a.Length && 0 <= j < a.Length ==> a[i] == a[j])
{
  // Implementation is omitted as per the request.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `a != null`: Ensures that the input array is not null, as working with a null array would lead to runtime errors.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`)**:
   - `result == (forall i, j :: 0 <= i < a.Length && 0 <= j < a.Length ==> a[i] == a[j])`: Ensures that the method returns `true` if and only if all elements in the array are the same. This is expressed using a universal quantifier (`forall`) to check that every pair of elements in the array is equal.

This design ensures that the method is both safe (due to the precondition) and correct (due to the postcondition).
