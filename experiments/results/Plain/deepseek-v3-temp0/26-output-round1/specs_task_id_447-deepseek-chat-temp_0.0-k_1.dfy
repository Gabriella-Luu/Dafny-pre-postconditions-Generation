Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method CubeElements(a: array<int>) returns (cubed: array<int>)
  requires a != null // Precondition: The input array must not be null.
  ensures cubed != null // Postcondition: The returned array must not be null.
  ensures cubed.Length == a.Length // Postcondition: The length of the returned array must match the input array.
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < a.Length ==> cubed[i] == a[i] * a[i] * a[i] // Postcondition: Each element in the returned array is the cube of the corresponding element in the input array.
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `a != null`: Ensures the input array `a` is not null to avoid null reference errors.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - `cubed != null`: Ensures the returned array `cubed` is not null.
   - `cubed.Length == a.Length`: Ensures the length of the returned array matches the length of the input array.
   - `forall i :: 0 <= i < a.Length ==> cubed[i] == a[i] * a[i] * a[i]`: Ensures each element in the returned array is the cube of the corresponding element in the input array. This guarantees the correctness of the method.
