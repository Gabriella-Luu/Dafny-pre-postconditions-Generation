Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed based on the task description:

```dafny
method SmallestMissingNumber(s: seq<int>) returns (v: int)
  // Preconditions
  requires forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |s| ==> s[i] <= s[j] // The sequence is sorted in non-decreasing order
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> s[i] >= 0 // All elements are natural numbers (non-negative)
  // Postconditions
  ensures v >= 0 // The result is a natural number
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> s[i] != v // The result is not in the sequence
  ensures forall k :: 0 <= k < v ==> exists i :: 0 <= i < |s| && s[i] == k // All numbers smaller than v are in the sequence
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - The sequence `s` is sorted in non-decreasing order (`s[i] <= s[j]` for all `i < j`).
   - All elements in `s` are natural numbers (non-negative).

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - The result `v` is a natural number (non-negative).
   - The result `v` is not present in the sequence `s`.
   - All natural numbers smaller than `v` are present in the sequence `s`.

These conditions ensure that the method correctly identifies the smallest missing natural number in the sorted sequence.
