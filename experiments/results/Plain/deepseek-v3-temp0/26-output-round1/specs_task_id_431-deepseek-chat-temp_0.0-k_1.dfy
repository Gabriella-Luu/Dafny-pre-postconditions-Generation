Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method HasCommonElement(a: array<int>, b: array<int>) returns (result: bool)
  requires a != null && b != null // Both arrays must be non-null
  ensures result == (exists i, j :: 0 <= i < a.Length && 0 <= j < b.Length && a[i] == b[j]) // The result is true if there exists at least one common element
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions (`requires`)**:
   - `a != null && b != null`: Ensures that both input arrays are non-null, as working with null arrays would lead to runtime errors.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `result == (exists i, j :: 0 <= i < a.Length && 0 <= j < b.Length && a[i] == b[j])`: Ensures that the result is `true` if and only if there exists at least one pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `a[i] == b[j]`. This captures the requirement that the arrays share at least one common element.
