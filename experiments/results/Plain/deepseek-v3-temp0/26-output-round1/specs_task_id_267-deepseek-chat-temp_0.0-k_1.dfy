Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method SumOfSquaresOfFirstNOddNumbers(n: int) returns (sum: int)
  // Precondition: n must be a non-negative integer
  requires n >= 0
  // Postcondition: sum is the sum of the squares of the first n odd natural numbers
  ensures sum == if n == 0 then 0 else sum == sum of (2k-1)^2 for k in 1..n
{
  // Implementation is omitted
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `n >= 0`: The input `n` must be a non-negative integer because we cannot compute the sum of the squares of a negative number of odd natural numbers.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`)**:
   - `sum == if n == 0 then 0 else sum == sum of (2k-1)^2 for k in 1..n`: This ensures that the returned `sum` is the sum of the squares of the first `n` odd natural numbers. If `n` is 0, the sum is 0. Otherwise, the sum is calculated as the sum of `(2k-1)^2` for `k` ranging from 1 to `n`.

This specification ensures the correctness of the method by clearly defining the expected behavior and constraints.
