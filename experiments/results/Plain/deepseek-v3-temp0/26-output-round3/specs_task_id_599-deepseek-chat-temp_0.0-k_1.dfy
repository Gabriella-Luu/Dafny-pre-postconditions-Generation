Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method SumAndAverage(n: int) returns (sum: int, average: real)
  // Preconditions
  requires n >= 0 // n must be a non-negative integer
  // Postconditions
  ensures sum == n * (n + 1) / 2 // sum of first n natural numbers
  ensures average == (if n == 0 then 0.0 else sum as real / n as real) // average of first n natural numbers
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `n >= 0`: The input `n` must be a non-negative integer because the sum and average of natural numbers are only defined for non-negative values of `n`.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - `sum == n * (n + 1) / 2`: This ensures that the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is correctly calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
   - `average == (if n == 0 then 0.0 else sum as real / n as real)`: This ensures that the average is correctly calculated. If `n` is 0, the average is 0.0 (to avoid division by zero). Otherwise, it is the sum divided by `n`, cast to a real number.

This design ensures the method is verified for correctness in Dafny.
