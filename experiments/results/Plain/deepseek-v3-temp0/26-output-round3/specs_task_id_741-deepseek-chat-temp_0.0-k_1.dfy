Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions designed based on the task description:

```dafny
method AllCharactersSame(s: string) returns (result: bool)
  // Precondition: The input string must not be null.
  requires s != null
  // Postcondition 1: If the string is empty, the result is true (all characters are trivially the same).
  ensures s.Length == 0 ==> result == true
  // Postcondition 2: If the string has only one character, the result is true (all characters are the same).
  ensures s.Length == 1 ==> result == true
  // Postcondition 3: If the string has more than one character, the result is true if and only if all characters are the same.
  ensures s.Length > 1 ==> (result == (forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < s.Length ==> s[i] == s[j])))
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - The input string `s` must not be null. This ensures the method operates on a valid string.

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - If the string is empty (`s.Length == 0`), the result is `true` because there are no characters to compare, so they are trivially the same.
   - If the string has only one character (`s.Length == 1`), the result is `true` because there is only one character.
   - If the string has more than one character (`s.Length > 1`), the result is `true` if and only if all characters in the string are the same. This is expressed using a universal quantifier (`forall`) to check that every pair of characters in the string is equal.

This design ensures the method behaves correctly according to the task description.
