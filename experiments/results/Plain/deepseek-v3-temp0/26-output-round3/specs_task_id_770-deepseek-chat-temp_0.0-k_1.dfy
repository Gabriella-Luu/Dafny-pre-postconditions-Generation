Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions based on the task description:

```dafny
method SumOfFourthPowerOfOddNumbers(n: int) returns (sum: int)
  // Precondition: n must be a non-negative integer
  requires n >= 0
  // Postcondition: sum is the sum of the fourth power of the first n odd natural numbers
  ensures sum == if n == 0 then 0 else sum == (1^4 + 3^4 + 5^4 + ... + (2n-1)^4)
{
  // Implementation not provided
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition (`requires`)**:
   - `n >= 0`: The input `n` must be a non-negative integer because we cannot have a negative number of terms in the sequence.

2. **Postcondition (`ensures`)**:
   - `sum == if n == 0 then 0 else sum == (1^4 + 3^4 + 5^4 + ... + (2n-1)^4)`: The sum is the sum of the fourth powers of the first `n` odd natural numbers. If `n` is 0, the sum is 0 (since there are no terms to sum). Otherwise, the sum is the sum of the fourth powers of the sequence `1, 3, 5, ..., (2n-1)`.

This ensures the method is correct and meets the requirements.
