```dafny
method closestNum(n: int) returns (res: int)
  requires n > int.MinValue
  ensures res < n
  ensures forall m: int :: m < n ==> m <= res
{
  // Implementation would go here, but is omitted for this example
  // res := n - 1;
}
``` 

The postcondition ensures that `res` is the closest (i.e., largest possible) number smaller than `n` by stating that all numbers smaller than `n` are less than or equal to `res`. This captures the requirement that `res` is the maximum possible number less than `n`, which is `n-1`. The precondition prevents integer underflow when subtracting 1 from the minimal integer value.
