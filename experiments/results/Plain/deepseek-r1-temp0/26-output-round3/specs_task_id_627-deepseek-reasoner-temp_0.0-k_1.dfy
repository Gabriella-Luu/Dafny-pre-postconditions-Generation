```dafny
method SmallestMissingNumber(s: seq<int>) returns (v: int)
   // The input sequence must be sorted in non-decreasing order
   requires forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |s| ==> s[i] <= s[j]
   // All elements in the sequence must be natural numbers (non-negative)
   requires forall x :: x in s ==> x >= 0
   // The returned value is a non-negative integer
   ensures v >= 0
   // The returned value is not present in the sequence
   ensures v !in s
   // All integers less than the returned value must be present in the sequence
   ensures forall m :: 0 <= m < v ==> m in s
