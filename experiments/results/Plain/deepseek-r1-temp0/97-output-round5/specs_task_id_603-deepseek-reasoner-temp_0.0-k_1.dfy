```dafny
method getLudic(n: int) returns (lucids: seq<int>)
   requires n >= 0
   ensures forall i :: i in lucids ==> 2 <= i <= n
   ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |lucids| ==> lucids[i] < lucids[j]
   ensures forall k :: 2 <= k <= n && isLudic(k) ==> k in lucids
   ensures forall k :: k in lucids ==> isLudic(k)
{
   // Implementation here
}

// Note: The isLudic predicate would need to be defined separately
// to verify the full correctness, but is not shown here.
