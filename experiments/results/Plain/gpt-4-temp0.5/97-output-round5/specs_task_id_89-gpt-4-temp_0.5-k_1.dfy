Here is the Dafny method signature with preconditions and postconditions:

```dafny
method closestNum(n: int) returns (res: int)
  requires n > int.MinValue   // n must be greater than the smallest possible integer
  ensures res == n - 1        // result must be one less than the input
  ensures res < n             // result must be less than the input
{}
```
