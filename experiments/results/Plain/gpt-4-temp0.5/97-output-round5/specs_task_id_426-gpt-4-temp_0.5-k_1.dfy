Here is the method signature with preconditions and postconditions:

```dafny
method filterOddNumbers (arr: array<int>) returns (odds: seq<int>)
  requires arr != null // precondition: the input array must not be null
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |odds| ==> odds[i] % 2 == 1 // postcondition: all numbers in the resulting sequence are odd
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |arr| && arr[i] % 2 == 1 ==> arr[i] in odds // postcondition: all odd numbers in the input array are in the resulting sequence
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |arr| && arr[i] % 2 == 1 && arr[j] % 2 == 1 ==> (arr[i] in odds && arr[j] in odds) ==> i < j ==> odds[i] < odds[j] // postcondition: the order of odd numbers in the resulting sequence is the same as in the input array
{
  // method implementation goes here
}
```

The first precondition ensures that the input array is not null.

The first postcondition ensures that all numbers in the resulting sequence are odd.

The second postcondition ensures that all odd numbers in the input array are included in the resulting sequence.

The third postcondition ensures that the order of odd numbers in the resulting sequence is the same as in the input array.
