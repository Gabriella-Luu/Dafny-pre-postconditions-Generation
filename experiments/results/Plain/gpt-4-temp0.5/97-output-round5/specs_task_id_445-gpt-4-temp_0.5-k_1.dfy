method indexMultiplication(a: seq<int>, b: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
    requires a != null && b != null // the input sequences must not be null
    requires |a| == |b| // the input sequences must have the same length
    ensures |result| == |a| // the output sequence has the same length as the input sequences
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |a| ==> result[i] == a[i]*b[i] // each element in the result sequence is the product of the corresponding elements in the input sequences
