Based on the task description, the preconditions and postconditions for the method `divList` in Dafny could be as follows:

```dafny
method divList(a: seq<int>, b: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
  requires a.Length == b.Length  // The two lists must be of the same length
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < b.Length ==> b[i] != 0  // No element in the second list should be 0 to avoid division by zero
  ensures result.Length == a.Length  // The result list should be of the same length as the input lists
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < result.Length ==> result[i] == a[i] / b[i]  // Each element in the result list should be the division of the corresponding elements in the input lists
{
  // Method implementation goes here
}
```

This method takes two sequences of integers `a` and `b` as input and returns a sequence `result`. The preconditions require that the two input sequences are of the same length and that no element in the second sequence is zero (to avoid division by zero). The postconditions ensure that the resulting sequence is of the same length as the input sequences and that each element in the resulting sequence is the division of the corresponding elements in the input sequences.
