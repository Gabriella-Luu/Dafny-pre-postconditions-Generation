method addTuple(l: seq<(int, int)>, t: (int, int)) returns (r: seq<(int, int)>)
  requires l != null && t != null // Preconditions
  ensures |r| == |l| + 1 // Postcondition: The length of the result sequence is one more than the length of the input sequence
  ensures r[|r|-1] == t // Postcondition: The last element of the result sequence is the tuple that was added
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |l| ==> r[i] == l[i] // Postcondition: All other elements are the same as in the input sequence
