```dafny
method diff(a: seq<int>, b: seq<int>) returns (diff: seq<int>)
  requires a != null && b != null // Precondition: Both input sequences a and b should not be null
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |diff| ==> (diff[i] in a && diff[i] not in b) // Postcondition: Every element in the returned sequence diff should be in sequence a and not in sequence b
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |a| ==> (a[i] in b || a[i] in diff) // Postcondition: Every element in sequence a should be either in sequence b or in the returned sequence diff
