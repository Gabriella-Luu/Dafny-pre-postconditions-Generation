method SumAndAverage(n: int) returns (sum: int, average: real)
  requires n >= 0 // you can only find the sum and average of first n natural numbers if n is non-negative
  ensures sum == n*(n+1)/2 // the sum of the first n natural numbers is given by the formula n*(n+1)/2
  ensures (n != 0 ==> average == sum/n) && (n == 0 ==> average == 0.0) // the average of the first n natural numbers is the sum divided by n, unless n is 0, in which case the average is 0

This method takes a non-negative integer n as an argument and returns two values: the sum of the first n natural numbers and their average. The preconditions ensure that n is non-negative, as you can't find the sum or average of a negative amount of numbers. The postconditions ensure that the sum is calculated correctly according to the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, and that the average is either the sum divided by n (if n is not zero) or zero (if n is zero).
