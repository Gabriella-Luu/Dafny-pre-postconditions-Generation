Sure, based on the task description, the preconditions and postconditions in Dafny can be designed as follows:

```dafny
method ReplaceChars(s: string, oldChar: char, newChar: char) returns (v: string)
  requires oldChar != newChar; // The old character should not be the same as the new character
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> (s[i] != oldChar ==> v[i] == s[i]); // If a character in the original string is not the old character, it should remain the same in the returned string
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> (s[i] == oldChar ==> v[i] == newChar); // If a character in the original string is the old character, it should be replaced with the new character in the returned string
  ensures |s| == |v|; // The length of the original string and the returned string should be the same
{
  // Method implementation goes here
}
```
This method has the precondition that the old character and the new character should not be the same. It ensures that all occurrences of the old character in the original string are replaced with the new character in the returned string, while all other characters remain the same. It also ensures that the length of the original string and the returned string are the same.
