method SmallestMissingNumber(s: seq<int>) returns (v: int)
  requires forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |s| ==> s[i] <= s[j] // The sequence is sorted in non-decreasing order
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> s[i] >= 0 // The sequence contains only natural numbers
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> s[i] < v // The returned value is greater than all elements in the sequence
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < v ==> exists j :: 0 <= j < |s| && s[j] == i // The returned value is the smallest number not in the sequence
{
  // Method implementation goes here
}
```
This method requires that the input sequence `s` is sorted in non-decreasing order and contains only natural numbers. It ensures that the returned value `v` is greater than all elements in the sequence and is the smallest number not in the sequence.
