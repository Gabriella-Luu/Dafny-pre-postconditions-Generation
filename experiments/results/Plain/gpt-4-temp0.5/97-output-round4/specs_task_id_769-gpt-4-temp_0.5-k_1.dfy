  requires a != null && b != null // The input lists must not be null
  ensures forall k :: 0 <= k < |diff| ==> (diff[k] in a && diff[k] not in b) // All elements in the difference list are in list a and not in list b
  ensures forall k :: 0 <= k < |a| ==> (a[k] in b || a[k] in diff) // All elements in list a are either in list b or in the difference list
