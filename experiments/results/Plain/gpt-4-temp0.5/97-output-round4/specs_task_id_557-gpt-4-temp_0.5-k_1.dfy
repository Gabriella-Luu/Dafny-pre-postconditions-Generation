Here is your Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions:

```dafny
method toggleString(str: string) returns (res: string)
  requires str != null; // The input string must not be null
  ensures |str| == |res|; // The output string must have the same length as the input string
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |str| ==> (
    // If the character in the input string is uppercase, the corresponding character in the output string is lowercase
    (str[i] in 'A'..'Z' ==> res[i] == str[i] + ('a' - 'A')) &&
    // If the character in the input string is lowercase, the corresponding character in the output string is uppercase
    (str[i] in 'a'..'z' ==> res[i] == str[i] - ('a' - 'A')) ||
    // If the character in the input string is not a letter, it remains the same in the output string
    (str[i] !in 'A'..'Z' && str[i] !in 'a'..'z' ==> res[i] == str[i])
  );
```

This method ensures that the input string is not null, the output string has the same length as the input string, and each character in the input string is toggled correctly in the output string.
