Here is the Dafny method signature with preconditions and postconditions:

```dafny
method DissimilarElements(a: array<int>, b: array<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
  requires a != null && b != null // The input arrays should not be null
  requires a.Length > 0 && b.Length > 0 // The input arrays should not be empty
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < result.Length ==> (result[i] in a[..] && result[i] !in b[..]) || (result[i] in b[..] && result[i] !in a[..]) 
  // All elements in the result sequence are either in array 'a' and not in array 'b', or in array 'b' and not in array 'a'
{
   // Method implementation
}
```

The preconditions ensure that the input arrays are not null and are not empty. The postcondition ensures that all elements in the result sequence are either in array 'a' and not in array 'b', or in array 'b' and not in array 'a', meaning that they are dissimilar elements.
