method divList(a: seq<int>, b: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
  requires a != null && b != null // both input sequences must not be null
  requires |a| == |b| // both input sequences must have the same length
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |b| ==> b[i] != 0 // no element in the second sequence should be zero to avoid division by zero error
  ensures |result| == |a| // the output sequence should have the same length as the input sequences
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] == a[i] / b[i] // each element in the output sequence should be the result of the division of the corresponding elements in the input sequences

  // Method implementation goes here
