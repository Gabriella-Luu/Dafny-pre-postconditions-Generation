```dafny
method addNestedSequence(a: seq<seq<int>>, b: seq<seq<int>>) returns (result: seq<seq<int>>)
  requires |a| == |b|
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |a| ==> |a[i]| == |b[i]|
  ensures |result| == |a|
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> |result[i]| == |a[i]|
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < |result| && 0 <= j < |result[i]| ==> result[i][j] == a[i][j] + b[i][j]
{
  // Method implementation goes here
}
```

Here's what the preconditions and postconditions mean:

- The first precondition `requires |a| == |b|` ensures that the two input sequences have the same length.
- The second precondition `requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |a| ==> |a[i]| == |b[i]|` ensures that corresponding nested sequences in `a` and `b` also have the same length.
- The first postcondition `ensures |result| == |a|` ensures that the resulting sequence has the same length as the input sequences.
- The second postcondition `ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> |result[i]| == |a[i]|` ensures that each nested sequence in the result has the same length as the corresponding nested sequences in the input.
- The final postcondition `ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < |result| && 0 <= j < |result[i]| ==> result[i][j] == a[i][j] + b[i][j]` ensures that each element in the resulting sequence is the sum of the corresponding elements in the input sequences.
