Based on the task description, we can infer that the input is a string and the output is a boolean value. The method should return true if the length of the string is odd, and false otherwise. Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions:

```dafny
method wordLen(str:string) returns (res:bool)
  requires str != null; // precondition: the input string should not be null
  ensures (str.Length % 2 == 1) ==> res == true; // postcondition: if the length of the string is odd, the result should be true
  ensures (str.Length % 2 == 0) ==> res == false; // postcondition: if the length of the string is even, the result should be false
{
  // Implementation here
}
```
The preconditions and postconditions are used to verify that the method behaves as expected. The precondition checks that the input string is not null. The postconditions check that the method correctly determines whether the length of the string is odd or even.
