Here are the preconditions and postconditions for the task:

```dafny
method indexMultiplication(a: seq<int>, b: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
  requires a.Length == b.Length // The two sequences must be of the same length
  ensures result.Length == a.Length // The result sequence should be of the same length as the input sequences
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < a.Length ==> result[i] == a[i] * b[i] // Each element in the result sequence should be the product of the corresponding elements in the input sequences
{
  // Method implementation goes here
}
```

The preconditions ensure that the input sequences are of the same length. The postconditions ensure that the result sequence is of the same length as the input sequences and that each element in the result sequence is the product of the corresponding elements in the input sequences.
