method AllCharactersSame(s: string) returns (result: bool)
  requires s.Length > 0  // The string must have at least one character
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < s.Length && 0 <= j < s.Length ==> s[i] == s[j] <==> result
  // The postcondition ensures that all characters in the string are the same if and only if the result is true

  // Method implementation goes here
