Here are the preconditions and postconditions for the described task:

```dafny
method SmallestMissingNumber(s: seq<int>) returns (v: int)
  requires forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |s| ==> s[i] <= s[j]  // The sequence is sorted in non-decreasing order
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> s[i] >= 0  // The sequence contains natural numbers only
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < v ==> i in s  // All numbers from 0 to v-1 are in the sequence
  ensures v !in s  // The number v is not in the sequence
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| && s[i] < v ==> i in s  // There is no number less than v not in the sequence
{
    // Method implementation here
}
```

This Dafny method's preconditions enforce that the input sequence is sorted and contains only natural numbers. The postconditions ensure that the returned number is the smallest missing number in the sequence. It guarantees that all numbers from 0 to v-1 are in the sequence, the number v is not in the sequence, and there is no number less than v not in the sequence.
