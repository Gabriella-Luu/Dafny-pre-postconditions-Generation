Here is a method signature with preconditions and postconditions for the task:

```dafny
method ReplaceChars(s: string, oldChar: char, newChar: char) returns (v: string)
  requires oldChar != newChar; // The oldChar should not be the same as the newChar
  requires s != null; // The input string should not be null
  ensures v != null; // The output string should not be null
  ensures v.Length == s.Length; // The length of the output string should be the same as the input string
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < s.Length ==> (s[i] == oldChar ==> v[i] == newChar) && (s[i] != oldChar ==> v[i] == s[i]);
  // If a character in the input string at position i is the same as oldChar, the character in the output string at the same position should be newChar.
  // If a character in the input string at position i is not the same as oldChar, the character in the output string at the same position should be the same as the character in the input string.
```
This method signature and its preconditions and postconditions ensure that the method replaces all instances of oldChar in the input string with newChar and leaves all other characters unchanged.
