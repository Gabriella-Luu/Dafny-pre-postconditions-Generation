```dafny
method RemoveElement(s: array<int>, k: int) returns (v: array<int>)
  requires s != null && 0 <= k < s.Length // precondition: s is not null and k is within the index range of s
  ensures v.Length == s.Length - 1 // postcondition: the returned array has one less element
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < k ==> v[i] == s[i] // all elements before the k'th element are the same in both arrays
  ensures forall i :: k <= i < v.Length ==> v[i] == s[i + 1] // all elements after the k'th element in the original array are shifted one position to the left in the returned array
{
  // method implementation goes here
}
