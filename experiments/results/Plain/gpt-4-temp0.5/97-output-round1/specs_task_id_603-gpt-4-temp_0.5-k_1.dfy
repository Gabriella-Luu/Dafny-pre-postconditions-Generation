```dafny
method getLudic(n: int) returns (lucids: seq<int>)
   requires n >= 1
   ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |lucids| ==> lucids[i] <= n && lucids[i] > 0
   ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |lucids| ==> lucids[i] < lucids[j] // lucids are in ascending order
   ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |lucids| - 2 ==> (lucids[i+2] - lucids[i]) != 1 // lucids[i+2] and lucids[i] are not consecutive
   // The first ludic number is 1, then remove every second number from the remaining numbers
   // The second ludic number is 3, then remove every third number from the remaining numbers
   // The nth ludic number is the nth number in the sequence, then remove every nth number from the remaining numbers
   // The sequence of lucid numbers starts with 1, 3
   ensures (|lucids| >= 1 ==> lucids[0] == 1) && (|lucids| >= 2 ==> lucids[1] == 3)
```
Note: The definition of lucid numbers is not universally agreed upon, so you may need to adjust the postconditions to match your specific definition. The definition I used is based on the one provided in the task description.
