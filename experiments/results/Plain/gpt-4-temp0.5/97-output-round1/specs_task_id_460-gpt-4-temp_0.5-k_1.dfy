Based on the task description, here is the Dafny method signature with preconditions and postconditions:

```dafny
method extract(list: seq<seq<int>>) returns (res: seq<int>)
  requires forall l :: l in list ==> |l| > 0  // Each sublist must have at least one element
  ensures |res| == |list|  // The result sequence should have the same length as the input list
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |list| ==> res[i] == list[i][0]  // Each element in the result sequence should be the first element of the corresponding sublist in the input list
{
  // Method implementation goes here
}
```

Here, the preconditions guarantee that each sublist in the input list has at least one element. The postconditions ensure that the result sequence has the same length as the input list, and each element in the result sequence is the first element of the corresponding sublist in the input list.
