```dafny
method divList(a: seq<int>, b: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
  requires a.Length == b.Length && forall i :: 0 <= i < b.Length ==> b[i] != 0
  ensures result.Length == a.Length && forall i :: 0 <= i < result.Length ==> result[i] == a[i] / b[i]
{
  // Method implementation goes here
}
```
The precondition requires that the two input sequences, `a` and `b`, are of the same length and none of the elements in `b` is zero (to avoid division by zero). 

The postcondition ensures that the length of the result sequence is the same as the length of the input sequences and that each element in the result sequence is the quotient of the corresponding elements in the input sequences.
