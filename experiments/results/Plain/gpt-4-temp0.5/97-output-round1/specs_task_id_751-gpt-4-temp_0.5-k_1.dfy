```dafny
method checkMinHeap(arr1: array<int>) returns (res: bool)
    requires arr1 != null && arr1.Length > 0
    ensures res == true <==> (forall i :: 0 <= i < arr1.Length/2 ==> arr1[i] <= arr1[2*i + 1] && (2*i + 2 < arr1.Length ==> arr1[i] <= arr1[2*i + 2]))
    ensures res == false <==> (exists i :: 0 <= i < arr1.Length/2 && (arr1[i] > arr1[2*i + 1] || (2*i + 2 < arr1.Length && arr1[i] > arr1[2*i + 2])))

    // Method implementation here

```
In the above code:

- The precondition requires that the input array is not null and its length is greater than 0.
- The postcondition ensures that if the result is true, then for all indices `i` from 0 to half of the array length, the element at index `i` is less than or equal to the elements at indices `2*i + 1` and `2*i + 2` (the children in the heap). This is the property of a min heap.
- The postcondition also ensures that if the result is false, then there exists an index `i` from 0 to half of the array length such that the element at index `i` is greater than the elements at indices `2*i + 1` or `2*i + 2`. This means that the array does not represent a min heap.
