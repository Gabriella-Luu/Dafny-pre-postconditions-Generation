```dafny
method indexMinimum(list: array<seq<int>>) returns (res:int)
  requires list != null && list.Length > 0
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < list.Length ==> list[i] != null && |list[i]| >= 2
  ensures 0 <= res < list.Length
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < list.Length ==> list[res][1] <= list[i][1]
```
Explanation:

The preconditions are:

- The input array `list` must not be null and its length must be greater than 0. This is to ensure that we have a valid array to work with.
- Every sequence in the array must not be null and must have at least two elements. This is because we are interested in the second value of each sequence.

The postconditions are:

- The returned index `res` must be within the valid range of the array indices. This is to ensure that the returned index is valid.
- The second value of the sequence at the returned index `res` must be less than or equal to the second value of all other sequences in the array. This is to ensure that the returned index indeed points to the sequence with the smallest second value.
