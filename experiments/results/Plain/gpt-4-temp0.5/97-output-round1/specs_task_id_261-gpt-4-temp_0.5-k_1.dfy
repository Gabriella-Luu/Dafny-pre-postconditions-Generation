method divisionElements(test_tup1:seq<int>, test_tup2:seq<int>) returns (res: seq<int>)
  requires |test_tup1| == |test_tup2|
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |test_tup2| ==> test_tup2[i] != 0
  ensures |res| == |test_tup1|
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |res| ==> res[i] == test_tup1[i] / test_tup2[i]
{
  // Method implementation goes here
}
```
Explanation:
1. The precondition `requires |test_tup1| == |test_tup2|` ensures that the two sequences have the same length, which is necessary for element-wise division.
2. The precondition `requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |test_tup2| ==> test_tup2[i] != 0` ensures that none of the elements in the second sequence are zero, to avoid division by zero.
3. The postcondition `ensures |res| == |test_tup1|` ensures that the result sequence has the same length as the input sequences.
4. The postcondition `ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |res| ==> res[i] == test_tup1[i] / test_tup2[i]` ensures that each element in the result sequence is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in the input sequences.
