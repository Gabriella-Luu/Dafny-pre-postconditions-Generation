method stringToChar(str:string) returns (res:seq<char>)
  requires str != null // The input string should not be null.
  ensures |res| == |str| // The length of the returned character array should be equal to the length of the input string.
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |str| ==> str[i] == res[i] // Each character in the returned array should be the same as the corresponding character in the input string.
