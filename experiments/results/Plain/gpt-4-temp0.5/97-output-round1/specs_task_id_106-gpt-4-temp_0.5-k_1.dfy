```dafny
method addLists(s: seq<int>, a: array<int>) returns (r: seq<int>)
  requires a != null // The array must not be null
  ensures |r| == |s| + a.Length // The length of the returned sequence is the sum of the length of the input sequence and the array
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> r[i] == s[i] // All elements in the input sequence are in the same order in the returned sequence
  ensures forall i :: |s| <= i < |r| ==> r[i] == a[i - |s|] // All elements in the input array are in the same order in the returned sequence, after the elements from the input sequence
