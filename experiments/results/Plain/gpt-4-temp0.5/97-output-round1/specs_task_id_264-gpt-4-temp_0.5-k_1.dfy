Here is the Dafny method with the preconditions and postconditions:

```dafny
method dogAge(hAge:int) returns (res:int)
    requires hAge >= 0; // The human age of the dog should be non-negative
    ensures res >= 0; // The dog's age in dog's years should be non-negative
    ensures hAge == 0 ==> res == 0; // If the human age is 0, then the dog's age is also 0
    ensures hAge > 0 ==> res == hAge * 7; // If the human age is more than 0, then the dog's age is human age times 7
{
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

This method assumes that 1 human year is equivalent to 7 dog years, which is a common approximation. The preconditions ensure that the input is valid (i.e., non-negative), and the postconditions ensure that the output is correct based on the input.
