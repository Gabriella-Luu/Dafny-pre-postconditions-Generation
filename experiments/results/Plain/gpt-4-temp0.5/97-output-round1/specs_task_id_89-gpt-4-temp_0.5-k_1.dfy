Here is the Dafny method with preconditions (requires) and postconditions (ensures) based on the task description:

```dafny
method closestNum(n:int) returns (res:int)
  requires n > int.MinValue; // n should be greater than the smallest possible integer
  ensures res == n - 1; // The result should be one less than the input number
  ensures res < n; // The result should be smaller than the input number
{
  // Method implementation goes here
}
```

The precondition ensures that the input number is greater than the smallest possible integer. This is to prevent underflow when we subtract one from the input number.

The postconditions ensure that the result is one less than the input number (which is the closest smaller number) and that the result is indeed smaller than the input number.
