method difference(n: int) returns (diff: int)
  requires n >= 0
  ensures diff == (n * (n + 1) / 2) * (n * (n + 1) / 2) - (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6)
```
This is based on the mathematical formulas for the sum of the first n natural numbers (n * (n + 1) / 2) and the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6). The precondition ensures that n is a non-negative integer, since the concept of a "natural number" doesn't include negative numbers. The postcondition ensures that the difference (diff) returned by the method is equal to the difference between the square of the sum of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers.
