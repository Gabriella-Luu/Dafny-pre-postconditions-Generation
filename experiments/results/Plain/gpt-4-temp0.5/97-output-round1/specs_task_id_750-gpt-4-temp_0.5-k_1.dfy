```dafny
method addTuple(l: seq<(int, int)>, t: (int, int)) returns (r: seq<(int, int)>)
  requires l != null // The input list should not be null
  ensures |r| == |l| + 1 // The returned list should have one more element than the input list
  ensures r[|r|-1] == t // The last element of the returned list should be the added tuple
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |l| ==> r[i] == l[i] // All elements in the input list should be preserved in the returned list at the same index
