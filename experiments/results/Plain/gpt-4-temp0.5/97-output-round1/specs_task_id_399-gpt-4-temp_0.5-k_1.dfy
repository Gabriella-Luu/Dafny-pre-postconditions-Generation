```dafny
method bitwiseXOR(sq1: seq<bv32>, sq2: seq<bv32>) returns (res: seq<bv32>)
  requires |sq1| == |sq2| // The two sequences must have the same length
  ensures |res| == |sq1| // The result sequence has the same length as the input sequences
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |sq1| ==> res[i] == (sq1[i] ^ sq2[i]) // Each element in the result sequence is the bitwise XOR of the corresponding elements in the input sequences
{
  // Method implementation goes here
}
```
In the above Dafny method, the precondition requires that the two input sequences sq1 and sq2 have the same length. The postconditions ensure that the result sequence res has the same length as the input sequences and each element in the result sequence is the bitwise XOR of the corresponding elements in the input sequences.
