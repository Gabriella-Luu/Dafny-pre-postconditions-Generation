method deepCloneSequence(s1:seq<int>) returns (res:seq<int>)
  requires true //no specific precondition needed for this task
  ensures |s1| == |res| && forall i :: 0 <= i < |s1| ==> s1[i] == res[i] //the returned sequence has the same length and elements as the input sequence

    // Method implementation goes here
