method indexMultiplication(a: seq<int>, b: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
  requires a != null && b != null // the input sequences must not be null
  requires |a| == |b| // the input sequences must have the same length
  ensures |result| == |a| // the output sequence has the same length as the input sequences
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |a| ==> result[i] == a[i] * b[i] // each element of the output sequence is the product of the corresponding elements of the input sequences
