  requires list != null && |list| > 0 // The list of lists must not be null and should contain at least one list
  ensures forall l :: l in list ==> |l| >= res // The length of all lists in the list of lists is greater than or equal to the result

  ensures res >= 0 // The result is a non-negative integer
