Sure, here is a Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions for the task.

```dafny
method centeredHexagonalNumber(n:int) returns (res:int)
  requires n >= 1  // precondition: n should be a positive integer
  ensures res == 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1  // postcondition: the result should be the nth centered hexagonal number
{
  // Method implementation goes here
}
```

The nth centered hexagonal number can be calculated using the formula 3n(n - 1) + 1. The precondition ensures that n is a positive integer, as the concept of a "centered hexagonal number" is not defined for non-positive integers. The postcondition ensures that the returned result is indeed the nth centered hexagonal number, according to the formula.
