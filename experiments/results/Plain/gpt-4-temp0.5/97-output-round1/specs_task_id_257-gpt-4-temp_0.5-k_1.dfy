method swapNumbers(a:int, b:int) returns (res: seq<int>)
  requires true // No specific preconditions as the method can handle all integer inputs
  ensures |res| == 2 // The resulting sequence should have exactly two elements
  ensures res[0] == b && res[1] == a // The first element of the result should be b and the second should be a
