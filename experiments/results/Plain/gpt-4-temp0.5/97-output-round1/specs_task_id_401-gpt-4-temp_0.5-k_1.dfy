This method has the following preconditions:
- Neither `a` nor `b` are `null`.
- `a` and `b` have the same length.
- Each nested sequence in `a` has the same length as the corresponding nested sequence in `b`.

The postconditions ensure that:
- The result is not `null`.
- The result has the same length as `a`.
- Each nested sequence in the result has the same length as the corresponding nested sequence in `a`.
- Each element in the result is the sum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.
