```dafny
method toggleString(str:string) returns (res:string)
  requires true
  ensures str.Length == res.Length && forall i :: 0 <= i < str.Length ==> 
    ((str[i] in 'a'..'z' ==> res[i] == str[i] - 'a' + 'A') && 
     (str[i] in 'A'..'Z' ==> res[i] == str[i] - 'A' + 'a') ||
     (str[i] !in 'a'..'z' && str[i] !in 'A'..'Z' ==> res[i] == str[i]))
{
  // Implementation goes here
}
```
This precondition and postcondition pair ensures that the output string has the same length as the input string and each character in the output string is the toggle case of the corresponding character in the input string. If the character in the input string is not a letter, it remains the same in the output string.
