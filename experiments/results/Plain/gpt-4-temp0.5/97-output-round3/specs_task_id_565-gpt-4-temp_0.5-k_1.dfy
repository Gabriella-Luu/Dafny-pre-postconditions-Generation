method split(str:string) returns (res:seq<char>)
  requires true // No specific precondition is required as a string can always be split into characters
  ensures |str| == |res| // The length of the result sequence should be equal to the length of the input string
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |str| ==> str[i] == res[i] // Each character in the result sequence should match the corresponding character in the input string
