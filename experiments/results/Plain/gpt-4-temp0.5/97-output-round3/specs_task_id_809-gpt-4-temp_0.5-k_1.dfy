Certainly! Based on the task description, we want to ensure that the method `checkSmaller` accepts two sequences of integers (`s1` and `s2`) and returns a boolean (`res`) indicating whether each element in the second sequence is smaller than its corresponding element in the first sequence. To achieve this, we must define appropriate preconditions and postconditions.

Preconditions:
1. The lengths of both sequences should be the same to compare each corresponding element.
2. (Optional) Both sequences should not be empty to perform meaningful comparisons, although this condition is not explicitly required by the task description.

Postconditions:
1. The result (`res`) should be true if and only if for every index `i` in the sequences, `s2[i] < s1[i]`.
2. If the sequences are empty, the result can be considered true, as there are no elements that violate the condition (vacuously true).

Here is how the method signature with the specified preconditions and postconditions would look in Dafny:

```dafny
method checkSmaller(s1: seq<int>, s2: seq<int>) returns (res: bool)
  requires s1.Length == s2.Length // Sequences must be of the same length
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < s1.Length ==> s2[i] < s1[i] ==> res // Each element of s2 is smaller than the corresponding element in s1
  ensures s1.Length == 0 ==> res // If sequences are empty, result is considered true
{
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

Note: The implementation is intentionally omitted as the task description asked for the method without implementation. The postconditions ensure the correctness of the method's output based on the task's requirements.
