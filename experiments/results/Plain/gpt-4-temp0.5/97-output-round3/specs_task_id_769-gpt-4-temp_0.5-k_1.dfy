  requires a != null && b != null // Both lists must be initialized
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |diff| ==> diff[i] in a && diff[i] !in b // All elements in the difference sequence are in the first sequence and not in the second
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |a| && a[i] !in b ==> a[i] in diff // All elements in the first sequence and not in the second sequence are in the difference sequence
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |b| && b[i] in a ==> b[i] !in diff // All elements in the second sequence and also in the first sequence are not in the difference sequence
