method indexMultiplication(a: seq<int>, b: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
    requires a != null && b != null // Sequences should not be null
    requires |a| == |b| // Sequences should have the same length
    ensures |result| == |a| // Result sequence should have the same length as input sequences
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |a| ==> result[i] == a[i] * b[i] // Each element in result sequence should be the product of corresponding elements in input sequences
