```dafny
method countSubstrings(str: string) returns (res: int)
  requires str != null; // The input string should not be null
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |str| ==> ('0' <= str[i] && str[i] <= '9'); // The input string should only contain digits
  ensures 0 <= res; // The result should be a non-negative integer
  ensures res <= |str|; // The result should not be more than the length of the string
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i <= j < |str| ==> 
    (sum(str[i..j]) == |str[i..j]| ==> res >= 1); // If there is a substring whose sum of digits equals its length, the result should be at least 1
{
  // Method body
}
```
Note: The `sum` function in the last postcondition is a hypothetical function that sums the digits in a substring. Dafny does not have this built-in function, so you would need to implement it yourself in your program.
