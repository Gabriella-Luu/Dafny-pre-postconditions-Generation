method divList(a: seq<int>, b: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
  requires a.Length == b.Length && forall i :: 0 <= i < b.Length ==> b[i] != 0
  ensures result.Length == a.Length && forall i :: 0 <= i < result.Length ==> result[i] == a[i] / b[i]

  // Method implementation here
}
```
This method requires that the two input lists have the same length and that no element in the second list is zero (to avoid division by zero). It ensures that the output list has the same length as the input lists and that each element in the output list is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in the input lists.
