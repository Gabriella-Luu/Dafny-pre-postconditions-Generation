Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions:

```dafny
method SumAndAverage(n: int) returns (sum: int, average: real)
  requires n >= 0  // n should be non-negative as it refers to first n natural numbers
  ensures sum == n*(n+1)/2  // formula for sum of first n natural numbers
  ensures (n != 0 ==> average == sum/n) && (n == 0 ==> average == 0.0)  // formula for average of first n natural numbers
{
  // method implementation
}
```
This method requires a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns the sum and the average of the first `n` natural numbers. The postconditions ensure that the method correctly calculates the sum and average according to the mathematical formulas for the sum and average of the first `n` natural numbers.
