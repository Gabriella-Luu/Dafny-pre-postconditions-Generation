```dafny
method countSubstrings(str: string) returns (res: int)
  requires str != null && forall i :: 0 <= i < |str| ==> ('0' <= str[i] <='9') // The input string should not be null and should only contain digits
  ensures 0 <= res // The result should be a non-negative integer
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i <= j < |str| ==> (sum(str[i..j]) == |str[i..j]| ==> res >= 1) // If there exists a substring whose sum of digits equals its length, the result should be at least 1
{
  // method implementation
}
```
In the precondition, we ensure that the input string is not null and only contains digits. In the postconditions, we ensure that the result is a non-negative integer and that if there exists a substring whose sum of digits equals its length, the result should be at least 1. The sum function in the postcondition represents the sum of the digits in the substring.
