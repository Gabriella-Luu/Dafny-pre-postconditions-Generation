Certainly! Designing preconditions and postconditions for a method in Dafny that removes duplicate numbers from a given integer array involves ensuring that the input is valid and the output meets the requirement of containing unique numbers only. Here is how you could define such a method in Dafny, including the preconditions and postconditions but without the implementation:

```dafny
method twoUniqueNums(nums: array<int>) returns (res: array<int>)
  requires nums != null // The input array must not be null.
  requires nums.Length > 0 // The input array must contain at least one element.
  ensures res != null // The result array must not be null.
  ensures forall i: int :: 0 <= i < res.Length ==> (exists j: int :: 0 <= j < nums.Length && nums[j] == res[i]) // Every element in the result array must exist in the input array.
  ensures forall i, j: int :: 0 <= i < j < res.Length ==> res[i] != res[j] // All elements in the result array must be unique.
  ensures forall k: int :: 0 <= k < nums.Length ==> (exists l: int :: 0 <= l < res.Length && nums[k] == res[l]) // Every unique element in the input array must exist in the result array.
{
  // Method implementation goes here.
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Preconditions**:
   - `requires nums != null`: Ensures the input array is not null to avoid null pointer exceptions.
   - `requires nums.Length > 0`: Ensures the input array has at least one element, as removing duplicates from an empty array is not meaningful.

2. **Postconditions**:
   - `ensures res != null`: Ensures the result array is not null.
   - `ensures forall i: int :: 0 <= i < res.Length ==> (exists j: int :: 0 <= j < nums.Length && nums[j] == res[i])`: Guarantees that every element in the result array was present in the input array.
   - `ensures forall i, j: int :: 0 <= i < j < res.Length ==> res[i] != res[j]`: Ensures all elements in the result array are unique, which is the main goal of this method.
   - `ensures forall k: int :: 0 <= k < nums.Length ==> (exists l: int :: 0 <= l < res.Length && nums[k] == res[l])`: Ensures that every unique element in the input array is represented in the result array, ensuring no unique element was mistakenly removed.

This method signature and its conditions set the stage for an implementation that would effectively remove duplicates from the input array, ensuring the output array contains only unique elements from the input, with all preconditions and postconditions aimed at verifying the correctness of such an operation.
