Certainly! For the task described, we need to design a Dafny method that identifies the dissimilar elements between two integer arrays. The preconditions and postconditions should reflect the requirements and the expected outcome of this operation.

Given the task, here are the essential considerations for preconditions and postconditions:

1. **Preconditions**: 
   - Both arrays `a` and `b` should not be null to ensure we can perform operations on them.
   - (Optional) Depending on the further specification, you might require the arrays to have a minimum length, but since finding dissimilar elements does not inherently require a minimum size (as even empty arrays are valid inputs), we might not specify this.

2. **Postconditions**:
   - Each element in the returned sequence `result` should not be present in both `a` and `b` simultaneously.
   - Every element in `result` should have appeared in either `a` or `b`.
   - The sequence `result` should not contain duplicates.
   - The size of `result` should be less than or equal to the sum of the sizes of `a` and `b`, as it cannot contain more elements than the total elements in both arrays.

Given these considerations, the Dafny method signature along with its preconditions and postconditions, without the actual implementation, would look like this:

```dafny
method DissimilarElements(a: array<int>, b: array<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
  requires a != null && b != null  // Preconditions
  ensures forall x :: x in result ==> (x in a && x !in b) || (x in b && x !in a)  // Postcondition 1
  ensures forall x :: x in result ==> x in a || x in b  // Postcondition 2
  ensures forall x, y :: x in result && y in result && x == y ==> result[x] == result[y]  // Postcondition 3
  ensures result.Length <= a.Length + b.Length  // Postcondition 4
{
  // Method implementation would go here.
}
```

Please note:
- The third postcondition ensures there are no duplicates in the `result` sequence. This condition is expressed with a bit of redundancy for clarity, aiming to highlight the uniqueness of elements within `result`. A more concise or different logical expression might be used depending on the specific behaviors and features of Dafny you want to leverage.
- The exact implementation logic to satisfy these conditions is not included, as the focus here is on designing the method signature, preconditions, and postconditions based on the requirements provided.
