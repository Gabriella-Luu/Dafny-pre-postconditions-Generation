Certainly! Based on the task description, we are designing a method in Dafny to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer `n`. The lucid numbers are a specific sequence, and for the purpose of this task, we'll assume it's well-defined within the context (though the actual definition of "lucid numbers" is not provided in the task description, they are not a standard mathematical sequence like primes or Fibonacci numbers, so let's proceed with a general understanding that we're working with a specific, identifiable sequence of numbers). 

Given this, we'll need to ensure that the input `n` is a positive integer for the method to make sense (as sequences are typically defined starting from 1 or another positive number, and finding elements "smaller than or equal to" a non-positive integer wouldn't fit our usual sequence contexts). As for the postconditions, we want to ensure that every element in the returned sequence `lucids` is indeed a lucid number and that no lucid number greater than `n` is included in the sequence. Additionally, we might want to ensure the sequence is sorted in ascending order (which is a common expectation for such tasks, though not explicitly stated in your requirements).

Hereâ€™s how the method signature with preconditions and postconditions might look:

```dafny
method getLudic(n: int) returns (lucids: seq<int>)
  requires n > 0 // The input must be a positive integer.
  ensures forall l :: l in lucids ==> l <= n // Every lucid number in the sequence is less than or equal to n.
  ensures forall l :: l in lucids ==> /* l is a lucid number */ // Placeholder for the actual definition of a lucid number.
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |lucids| ==> lucids[i] < lucids[j] // The sequence is sorted in ascending order.
  ensures forall l :: l <= n && /* l is a lucid number */ ==> l in lucids // Every lucid number less than or equal to n is in the sequence.
{
  // Method implementation would go here.
}
```

Note: The comments `/* l is a lucid number */` are placeholders where the specific definition or predicate identifying a lucid number should be placed. Since the task doesn't define what a lucid number is, these placeholders indicate where such logic would need to be incorporated. In a real implementation, you would replace these comments with the actual logic or conditions that define a lucid number.
