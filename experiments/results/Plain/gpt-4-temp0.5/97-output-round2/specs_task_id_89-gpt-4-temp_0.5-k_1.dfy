Here is the Dafny method with preconditions and postconditions:

```dafny
method closestNum(n:int) returns (res:int)
  requires n > int.MinValue; // n must be greater than the minimum int value
  ensures res == n - 1; // the result should be one less than the input
  ensures res < n; // the result should be less than the input
{
  // Method implementation goes here
}
```

The precondition `requires n > int.MinValue` ensures that the input number is greater than the minimum integer value. This is necessary because if `n` is equal to `int.MinValue`, there would be no smaller integer value than `n`.

The postconditions `ensures res == n - 1` and `ensures res < n` guarantee that the method returns a number that is one less than the input and that the returned number is indeed less than the input.
