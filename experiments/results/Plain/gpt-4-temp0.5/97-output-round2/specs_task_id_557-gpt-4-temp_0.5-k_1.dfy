Certainly! To design preconditions and postconditions for the task of toggling the case of all characters in a string using Dafny, we need to focus on what we expect before the method runs (preconditions) and what the method guarantees after it completes (postconditions). For this task, the preconditions might be minimal since the operation should work on any string. The postconditions, however, should ensure that each character in the returned string has the opposite case from the corresponding character in the input string.

Here is how the Dafny method signature might look with the preconditions and postconditions:

```dafny
method toggleString(str: string) returns (res: string)
  // Preconditions
  requires true  // No specific requirements for input string
  // Postconditions
  ensures res.Length == str.Length  // Ensure the result string has the same length as the input string
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < str.Length ==>
            (str[i].isUpper() ==> res[i].isLower()) && (str[i].isLower() ==> res[i].isUpper()) 
  // This ensures that for each character in the input string, if it was uppercase, it is now lowercase in the result, and vice versa.
  // Note: Dafny does not directly support .isUpper() and .isLower() methods. This is a conceptual representation.
  // You would need to implement or adapt these checks based on character ASCII values or through a helper method in Dafny.
```

Please note, the `isUpper()` and `isLower()` methods are not directly available in Dafny as written. This is a conceptual representation to express the intended logic. In a real Dafny implementation, you would need to define these checks yourself, likely by comparing character codes to determine if a character is uppercase or lowercase and then toggling its case accordingly.

This design ensures that the method `toggleString` adheres to the described behavior, guaranteeing the length of the result string matches the input and that each character's case is toggled. Implementing the actual logic would involve iterating over each character in the input string, checking its case, and converting it accordingly, which is not detailed here as the focus is on preconditions and postconditions.
