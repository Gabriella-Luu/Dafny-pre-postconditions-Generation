method sumOfCommonDivisor(a:int, b:int) returns (res:int)
  requires a > 0 && b > 0  // The inputs must be positive integers
  ensures forall d :: d > 0 && d < a && d < b ==> (a % d == 0 && b % d == 0) ==> res >= d  
  // The result must be at least as large as any common divisor of a and b
  ensures forall d :: d > 0 && d < a && d < b ==> (a % d == 0 && b % d == 0) ==> res % d == 0  
  // The result must be divisible by any common divisor of a and b
