Certainly, designing preconditions and postconditions in Dafny involves specifying what must be true before a method is called and what is guaranteed to be true after the method has been executed, respectively. For the task of splitting a string into characters, the preconditions might be minimal since the operation can be applied to any string. However, the postconditions will be crucial to ensure the method's correctness, specifically that the resulting sequence of characters matches the input string when concatenated.

Here's how the Dafny method signature with the specified preconditions and postconditions could look:

```dafny
method split(str: string) returns (res: seq<char>)
  // Preconditions
  requires true  // No specific precondition as the operation is valid for any string.
  // Postconditions
  ensures str == res[..].ToString()  // The concatenation of the result sequence should equal the input string.
  ensures |res| == str.Length  // The length of the result sequence should be the same as the input string.
{
  // Method implementation would go here.
}
```

In this setup:
- The `requires` clause is trivial (`true`) because there are no restrictions on the input string for this operation.
- The first `ensures` clause guarantees that when you concatenate all characters in the resulting sequence (`res[..].ToString()`), you get back the original string (`str`). This ensures that no characters are lost or altered during the splitting process.
- The second `ensures` clause ensures that the length of the resulting character sequence (`|res|`) is the same as the length of the input string (`str.Length`). This is another way to ensure that the split operation correctly handles every character in the input string.

Note: The actual implementation of the `split` method is not provided here, as the focus is on designing the preconditions and postconditions based on the task description.
