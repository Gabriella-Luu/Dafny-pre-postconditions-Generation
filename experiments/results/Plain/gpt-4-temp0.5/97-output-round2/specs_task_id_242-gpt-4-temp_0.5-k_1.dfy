Here are the preconditions and postconditions for this task:

```dafny
method countCharacter(str: string) returns (res: int)
  requires str != null; // the input string must not be null
  ensures res == |str|; // the result must be equal to the length of the string
```

This method doesn't need a complex precondition because a string in Dafny can't be null. The postcondition ensures that the result is equal to the length of the string, which is the total number of characters in the string.
