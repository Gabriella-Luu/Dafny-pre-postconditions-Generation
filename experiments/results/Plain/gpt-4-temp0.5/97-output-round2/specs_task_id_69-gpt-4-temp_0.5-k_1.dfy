Here is the Dafny method with the preconditions and postconditions:

```dafny
method isSublist (list: seq<seq<int>>, sub: seq<int>) returns (res: bool)
  requires list != null && sub != null // the input sequences should not be null
  ensures res == true <==> exists i :: 0 <= i < |list| && list[i] == sub // the result is true if and only if the subsequence exists in the list
  ensures res == false <==> forall i :: 0 <= i < |list| ==> list[i] != sub // the result is false if and only if the subsequence does not exist in the list
{
  // Method implementation goes here
}
```
In the above Dafny method:
- The `requires` clause is the precondition that checks if the input sequences are not null.
- The `ensures` clause is the postcondition that guarantees the correctness of the method's return value. It states that the method returns `true` if and only if the subsequence exists in the list, and `false` if and only if the subsequence does not exist in the list.
