method indexMultiplication(a: seq<int>, b: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
  requires a != null && b != null // The input sequences are not null
  requires |a| == |b| // The input sequences have the same length
  ensures |result| == |a| // The result sequence has the same length as the input sequences
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |a| ==> result[i] == a[i] * b[i] // Each element in the result sequence is the product of the corresponding elements in the input sequences
