method addTuple(l: seq<(int, int)>, t: (int, int)) returns (r: seq<(int, int)>)
    requires l != null; // The list should not be null
    ensures |r| == |l| + 1; // The length of the resulting list should be one more than the original list
    ensures r[|r|-1] == t; // The last element of the resulting list should be the tuple that was added
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |l| ==> r[i] == l[i]; // All the elements in the original list should be in the same order in the resulting list
