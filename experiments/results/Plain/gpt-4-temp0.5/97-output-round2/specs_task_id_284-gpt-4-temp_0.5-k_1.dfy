Certainly! Based on the task description, the method `checkElement` should verify if every element in the input array `a1` is equal to the given element `e`. The result is a boolean `res` indicating whether this condition holds for the entire array.

Since the task description does not specify any constraints on the input (such as the array needing to be non-empty), there are no explicit preconditions (`requires`) necessary for this method. However, it's always good practice to ensure the array is not `null` in Dafny to avoid runtime errors. Therefore, a precondition that `a1` is not `null` would be prudent.

The postcondition (`ensures`) needs to express that if `res` is `true`, then every element in `a1` is equal to `e`. Conversely, if `res` is `false`, there exists at least one element in `a1` that is not equal to `e`. These conditions can be expressed using quantifiers in Dafny.

Here's how the method signature with preconditions and postconditions would look:

```dafny
method checkElement(a1: array<int>, e: int) returns (res: bool)
  requires a1 != null  // The array must not be null.
  ensures forall i: int :: (0 <= i < a1.Length) ==> (a1[i] == e) <==> res  // All elements in the array are equal to 'e' if and only if 'res' is true.
{
   // Method implementation goes here.
}
```

This setup ensures that before the method is called, the input array `a1` is guaranteed not to be `null`. After the method completes, the result `res` accurately reflects whether all elements in `a1` are equal to `e`, as per the task description.
