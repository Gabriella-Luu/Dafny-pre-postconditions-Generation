Certainly! Given the task of filtering odd numbers from an array and returning a sequence of these odd numbers in Dafny, here's how the method signature, along with its preconditions and postconditions, would look. Note that, given the nature of the task, the preconditions are minimal because the operation can be applied to any integer array. The postconditions focus on ensuring that the output sequence contains only odd numbers and that all odd numbers from the input array are present in the output sequence.

```dafny
method filterOddNumbers(arr: array<int>) returns (odds: seq<int>)
  // Preconditions
  requires arr != null // Ensure the input array is not null

  // Postconditions
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < odds.Length ==> odds[i] % 2 != 0 // All numbers in the output sequence are odd
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < arr.Length && arr[i] % 2 != 0 ==> odds.Contains(arr[i]) // All odd numbers from the input array are in the output sequence
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < odds.Length ==> arr.Contains(odds[i]) // All numbers in the output sequence are from the input array
{
   // Implementation would go here
}
```

This method signature, along with its preconditions and postconditions, outlines a contract that ensures:

1. The input array is not null.
2. Every element in the returned sequence is an odd number.
3. Every odd number from the input array is included in the returned sequence.
4. Every number in the returned sequence was in the input array.

These conditions together ensure that the method `filterOddNumbers` correctly filters all and only the odd numbers from the input array `arr` into the output sequence `odds`.
