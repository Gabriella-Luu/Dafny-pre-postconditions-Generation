```dafny
method isDecimal(str:string) returns (res:bool)
  requires str != null; // The input string cannot be null
  ensures res == true <==> 
    (str.Length > 0 && str.Length <= 4) && // The string length should be between 1 and 4
    (forall i :: 0 <= i < str.Length ==> ('0' <= str[i] && str[i] <= '9')) && // Every character in the string should be a digit
    (str.Length < 4 || str[str.Length - 3] == '.'); // If the string length is 4, the third character from the end should be a dot
```
The postcondition ensures that the result of the method is true if and only if the string represents a decimal number with a precision of 2. This is achieved by checking that the string is not empty and has at most 4 characters, all characters are digits, and if there are 4 characters, the third one from the end is a dot, representing the decimal point.
