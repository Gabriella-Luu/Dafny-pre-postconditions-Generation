Given the task description, we're designing a method in Dafny to check if there is any value that exists in both of the given sequences. The method signature is provided, and we need to specify the preconditions and postconditions without implementing the method's body. The preconditions (requires) for this task might not be strictly necessary since we're working with sequences, which are inherently well-defined in Dafny (e.g., no need to check for null or initialization). However, postconditions (ensures) are crucial for specifying the expected outcome based on the input sequences. 

Here's how you might define the method in Dafny, including the preconditions and postconditions:

```dafny
method overlapping(list1: seq<int>, list2: seq<int>) returns (res: bool)
  // Preconditions (None are strictly necessary for this task)
  
  // Postconditions
  ensures res <==> exists i :: i in list1 && i in list2
  // The method returns true (res is true) if and only if there exists at least one element i that is present in both list1 and list2.
{
  // Method implementation is not provided as per the task requirement.
}
```

Explanation of the Postcondition:
- `res <==> exists i :: i in list1 && i in list2`: This postcondition specifies that the result (`res`) of the method should be true if and only if there exists at least one element `i` that is present in both `list1` and `list2`. This directly translates the task requirement into a logical condition in Dafny. If no such element exists, `res` should be false, which is also covered by this postcondition.
