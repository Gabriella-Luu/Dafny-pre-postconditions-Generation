    requires |a| == |b|
    requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |b| ==> b[i] != 0

}
```
Explanation:

In the preconditions:

- `requires a != null && b != null` ensures that the input sequences are not null.
- `requires |a| == |b|` ensures that the input sequences have the same length.
- `requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |b| ==> b[i] != 0` ensures that there are no zero elements in the second sequence (to avoid division by zero).

In the postconditions:

- `ensures |result| == |a|` ensures that the output sequence has the same length as the input sequences.
- `ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] == a[i] / b[i]` ensures that each element in the output sequence is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in the input sequences.
