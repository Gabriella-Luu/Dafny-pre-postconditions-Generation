Certainly! For the task of checking if the length of a word is odd, we don't specifically need any preconditions because the method should be able to handle any string input. However, the postcondition should reflect that the method returns `true` if the length of the string (`str`) is odd, and `false` otherwise. Here's how the method signature with the specified postcondition looks:

```dafny
method wordLen(str: string) returns (res: bool)
  ensures res <==> str.Length % 2 == 1
{
  // Method implementation is omitted as per the request.
}
```

This postcondition uses the equivalence operator `<==>` to state that `res` is true if and only if the length of `str` is odd (i.e., `str.Length % 2 == 1`). This succinctly captures the requirement.
